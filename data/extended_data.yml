      abstract: Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for
        detecting objects at different scales. But pyramid representations have been
        avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks,
        partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this paper,
        we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional
        networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down
        architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level
        semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid
        Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor
        in several applications. Using a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves
        state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without
        bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including
        those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run
        at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale
        object detection. Code will be made publicly available.

      abstract: Consumers are exposed to advertisements across many different domains
        on the internet, such as fashion, beauty, car, food, and others. On the other
        hand, fashion represents second highest e-commerce shopping category. Does
        consumer digital record behavior on various fashion ad images reveal their
        fashion taste? Does ads from other domains infer their fashion taste as well?
        In this paper, we study the correlation between advertisements and fashion
        taste. Towards this goal, we introduce a new dataset, Fashionpedia-Ads, which
        asks subjects to provide their preferences on both ad (fashion, beauty, car,
        and dessert) and fashion product (social network and e-commerce style) images.
        Furthermore, we exhaustively collect and annotate the emotional, visual and
        textual information on the ad images from multi-perspectives (abstractive
        level, physical level, captions, and brands). We open-source Fashionpedia-Ads
        to enable future studies and encourage more approaches to interpretability
        research between advertisements and fashion taste.

      abstract: 'We present a novel approach to measuring similarity between shapes
        and exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement of
        similarity is preceded by: (1) solving for correspondences between points
        on the two shapes; (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform.
        In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the
        shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures
        the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally
        discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes
        will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences
        as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate
        the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate
        splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose.

      abstract: Unsupported and unfalsifiable claims we encounter in our daily lives
        can influence our view of the world. Characterizing, summarizing, and -- more
        generally -- making sense of such claims, however, can be challenging. In
        this work, we focus on fine-grained debate topics and formulate a new task
        of distilling, from such claims, a countable set of narratives. We present
        a crowdsourced dataset of 12 controversial topics, comprising more than 120k
        arguments, claims, and comments from heterogeneous sources, each annotated
        with a narrative label. We further investigate how large language models (LLMs)
        can be used to synthesise claims using In-Context Learning. We find that generated
        claims with supported evidence can be used to improve the performance of narrative
        classification models and, additionally, that the same model can infer the
        stance and aspect using a few training examples. Such a model can be useful
        in applications which rely on narratives , e.g. fact-checking.

      abstract: 'Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders
        a content image in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer.
        However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which
        limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural
        networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately,
        the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed
        set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we
        present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary
        style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive
        instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of
        the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves
        speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction
        to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible
        user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color
        & spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.'

      abstract: Multimodal vision and language (VL) models have recently shown strong
        performance in phrase grounding and object detection for both zero-shot and
        finetuned cases. We adapt a VL model (GLIP) for keypoint detection and evaluate
        on NABirds keypoints. Our language-based keypoints-as-objects detector GLIP-KP
        outperforms baseline top-down keypoint detection models based on heatmaps
        and allows for zero- and few-shot evaluation. When fully trained, enhancing
        the keypoint names with descriptive attributes gives a significant performance
        boost, raising AP by as much as 6.0, compared to models without attribute
        information. Our model exceeds heatmap-based HRNet’s AP by 4.4 overall and
        8.4 on keypoints with attributes. With limited data, attributes raise zero-/one-/few-shot
        test AP by 1.0/3.4/1.6, respectively, on keypoints with attributes.

      abstract: Understanding the dynamics of spreading and diffusion on networks
        is of critical importance for a variety of processes in real life. However,
        predicting the temporal evolution of diffusion on networks remains challenging
        as the process is shaped by network topology, spreading non-linearities, and
        heterogeneous adaptation behavior. In this study, we propose the ‘spindle
        vector’, a new network topological feature, which characterizes the hierarchical
        organization of nodes. The spindle vector shapes nodes according to the distance
        from the root node, capturing the essence of diffusion propagation, thus allowing
        us to approximate the spatiotemporal evolution of diffusion dynamics on networks.
        Through experiments on various networks, we show that our method outperforms
        the state-of-the-art, such that the prediction error of RMSE and MAE is 100%
        superior on WS and BA networks, and that the prediction is better than the
        counterpart model in 36 out of 40 empirical networks. The new metric provides
        a general and computationally efficient approach to predict network diffusion
        problems and is of potential for a large range of network applications.

        In social media sentiment analysis and related tasks, researchers have therefore

        Our paper shows that by extending the distant supervision to a more diverse
        set of noisy labels, the models can learn richer representations. Through
        emoji prediction on a dataset of 1246 million tweets containing one of 64
        common emojis we obtain state-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmark datasets
        within sentiment, emotion and sarcasm detection using a single pretrained

      abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with an increased
        risk of stroke, cognitive decline, and dementia. A robust, yet accurate detection
        of WMH can help with the prevention of more lesions from forming. The task
        is still challenging as the lesions are often small and irregular. Hence,
        we propose a robust deep learning-based method for the automatic segmentation
        of WMH only using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans and MRI-specific
        data augmentation and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The methods
        are tested on public and private data, and we show that our model is more
        robust to domain shift and achieves higher segmentation accuracy than the
        alternatives.

      abstract: Gaussian scale-space is one of the best understood multi-resolution
        techniques available to the computer vision and image analysis community.
        It is the purpose of this book to guide the reader through some of its main
        aspects. During an intensive weekend in May 1996 a workshop on Gaussian scale-space
        theory was held in Copenhagen, which was attended by many of the leading experts
        in the field. The bulk of this book originates from this workshop. Presently
        there exist only two books on the subject. In contrast to Lindeberg's monograph
        (Lindeberg, 1994e) this book collects contributions from several scale space
        researchers, whereas it complements the book edited by ter Haar Romeny (Haar
        Romeny, 1994) on non-linear techniques by focusing on linear diffusion. This
        book is divided into four parts. The reader not so familiar with scale-space
        will find it instructive to first consider some potential applications described
        in Part 1. Parts II and III both address fundamental aspects of scale-space.
        Whereas scale is treated as an essentially arbitrary constant in the former,
        the latter em phasizes the deep structure, ie the structure that is revealed
        by varying scale. Finally, Part IV is devoted to non-linear extensions, notably
        non-linear diffusion techniques and morphological scale-spaces, and their
        relation to the linear case. The Danish National Science Research Council
        is gratefully acknowledged for providing financial support for the workshop
        under grant no. 9502164.

        on a voxel/pixel classification approach. Deep learning systems, such as convolutional

      abstract: 'Deep learning models are complex due to their size, structure, and
        inherent randomness in training procedures. Additional complexity arises from
        the selection of datasets and inductive biases. Addressing these challenges
        for explainability, Kim et al. (2018) introduced Concept Activation Vectors
        (CAVs), which aim to understand deep models'' internal states in terms of
        human-aligned concepts. These concepts correspond to directions in latent
        space, identified using linear discriminants. Although this method was first
        applied to image classification, it was later adapted to other domains, including
        natural language processing. In this work, we attempt to apply the method
        to electroencephalogram (EEG) data for explainability in Kostas et al.''s
        BENDR (2021), a large-scale transformer model. A crucial part of this endeavor
        involves defining the explanatory concepts and selecting relevant datasets
        to ground concepts in the latent space. Our focus is on two mechanisms for
        EEG concept formation: the use of externally labeled EEG datasets, and the
        application of anatomically defined concepts. The former approach is a straightforward
        generalization of methods used in image classification, while the latter is
        novel and specific to EEG. We present evidence that both approaches to concept
        formation yield valuable insights into the representations learned by deep
        EEG models.'

      abstract: 'Several recent works have adapted Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) for
        learning general-purpose audio representations. However, they do not address
        two key aspects of modelling multi-domain audio data: (i) real-world audio
        tasks consist of a combination of local+global contexts, and (ii) real-world
        audio signals are complex compositions of several acoustic elements with different
        time-frequency characteristics. To address these concerns, this work proposes
        a Multi-Window Masked Autoencoder (MW-MAE) fitted with a novel Multi-Window
        Multi-Head Attention module that can capture information at multiple local
        and global contexts in every decoder transformer block through attention heads
        of several distinct local and global windows. Empirical results on ten downstream
        audio tasks show that MW-MAEs consistently outperform standard MAEs in overall
        performance and learn better general-purpose audio representations, as well
        as demonstrate considerably better scaling characteristics. Exploratory analyses
        of the learned representations reveals that MW-MAE encoders learn attention
        heads with more distinct entropies compared to those learned by MAEs, while
        attention heads across the different transformer blocks in MW-MAE decoders
        learn correlated feature representations, enabling each block to independently
        capture local and global information, leading to a decoupled feature hierarchy.

        ability to analyze text through flexible computational models. Due to their
        structural similarity to written language, transformer-based architectures
        have also shown promise as tools to make sense of a range of multi-variate
        sequences from protein-structures, music, electronic health records to weather-forecasts.
        We can also represent human lives in a way that shares this structural similarity
        to language. From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People
        are born, visit the pediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get
        married, and so on. Here, we exploit this similarity to adapt innovations
        from natural language processing to examine the evolution and predictability
        of human lives based on detailed event sequences. We do this by drawing on
        arguably the most comprehensive registry data in existence, available for
        an entire nation of more than six million individuals across decades. Our
        data include information about life-events related to health, education, occupation,
        income, address, and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution. We
        create embeddings of life-events in a single vector space showing that this
        embedding space is robust and highly structured. Our models allow us to predict
        diverse outcomes ranging from early mortality to personality nuances, outperforming
        state-of-the-art models by a wide margin. Using methods for interpreting deep

        whether sets of voxels are activated in a similar way or in different ways.
        Typically, delays between two activated signals are not identified. In this

      abstract: 'The development of “intelligent” systems that can take decisions
        and perform autonomously might lead to faster and more consistent decisions.
        A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent
        risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent”
        machines. For sensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting
        human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper,
        non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system,
        we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees
        that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world
        environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement
        between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have
        been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused
        on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable
        manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of
        algorithms, theory, and applications of interpretable and explainable AI and
        AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse
        in this field and providing directions of future development. The book is
        organized in six parts: towards AI transparency; methods for interpreting

      abstract: The current study of human-machine alignment aims at understanding
        the geometry of latent spaces and the correspondence to human representations.
        G\"ardenfors' conceptual spaces is a prominent framework for understanding
        human representations. Convexity of object regions in conceptual spaces is
        argued to promote generalizability, few-shot learning, and intersubject alignment.
        Based on these insights, we investigate the notion of convexity of concept
        regions in machine-learned latent spaces. We develop a set of tools for measuring
        convexity in sampled data and evaluate emergent convexity in layered representations
        of state-of-the-art deep networks. We show that convexity is robust to basic
        re-parametrization, hence, meaningful as a quality of machine-learned latent
        spaces. We find that approximate convexity is pervasive in neural representations
        in multiple application domains, including models of images, audio, human
        activity, text, and brain data. We measure convexity separately for labels
        (i.e., targets for fine-tuning) and other concepts. Generally, we observe
        that fine-tuning increases the convexity of label regions, while for more
        general concepts, it depends on the alignment of the concept with the fine-tuning
        objective. We find evidence that pre-training convexity of class label regions
        predicts subsequent fine-tuning performance.

      abstract: Super-resolution, the process of obtaining one or more high-resolution
        images from one or more low-resolution observations, has been a very attractive
        research topic over the last two decades. It has found practical applications
        in many real-world problems in different fields, from satellite and aerial
        imaging to medical image processing, to facial image analysis, text image
        analysis, sign and number plates reading, and biometrics recognition, to name

      abstract: ' This work focuses on achieving a weather-agnostic approach for the
        real-world deployment of object recognition algorithms. Particularly object
        recognition conducted on thermal data exposed to long-term thermal drift.
        Deployments of real-world object detection systems often experience a degradation
        in performance over time due to concept drift. Systems that leverage thermal
        cameras are especially susceptible because the respective thermal signatures
        of objects and their surroundings are highly sensitive to environmental changes.
        In this study, two types of weather-aware latent conditioning methods are
        investigated. The proposed method aims to guide two object detectors, (YOLOv5
        and Deformable DETR) to become weather-aware. This is achieved by leveraging
        an auxiliary branch that predicts weather-related information while conditioning
        intermediate layers of the object detector. While the conditioning methods
        proposed do not directly improve the accuracy of baseline detectors, it can
        be observed that conditioned networks manage to extract a weather-related
        signal from the thermal images, thus resulting in a decreased miss rate at
        the cost of increased false positives. The extracted signal appears noisy
        and is thus challenging to regress accurately. This is most likely a result
        of the qualitative nature of the thermal sensor; thus, further work is needed
        to identify an ideal method for optimizing the conditioning branch, as well
        as to further improve the accuracy of the system.'

      abstract: Masked image modeling has been demonstrated as a powerful pretext
        task for generating robust representations that can be effectively generalized
        across multiple downstream tasks. Typically, this approach involves randomly
        masking patches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining
        unchanged during training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning
        approach that updates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity
        of the self-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually
        increasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and
        transferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel learnable
        masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of different
        complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked autoencoders (MAE).
        Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting its behavior during
        training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE (optimizing the same reconstruction
        loss) to an adversary (optimizing the opposite loss), while passing through
        a neutral state. The transition between these behaviors is smooth, being regulated
        by a factor that is multiplied with the reconstruction loss of the masking
        module. The resulting training procedure generates an easy-to-hard curriculum.
        We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked Autoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and
        show that it exhibits superior representation learning capabilities compared
        to MAE. The empirical results on five downstream tasks confirm our conjecture,
        demonstrating that curriculum learning can be successfully used to self-supervise

      abstract: Thermal cameras are passive sensors that capture the infrared radiation
        emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero. This type of
        camera was originally developed as a surveillance and night vision tool for
        the military, but recently the price has dropped, significantly opening up
        a broader field of applications. Deploying this type of sensor in vision systems
        eliminates the illumination problems of normal greyscale and RGB cameras.
        This survey provides an overview of the current applications of thermal cameras.
        Applications include animals, agriculture, buildings, gas detection, industrial,
        and military applications, as well as detection, tracking, and recognition
        of humans. Moreover, this survey describes the nature of thermal radiation
        and the technology of thermal cameras.

      abstract: The intelligibility and quality of speech from a mobile phone or public
        announcement system are often affected by background noise in the listening
        environment. By pre-processing the speech signal it is possible to improve
        the speech intelligibility and quality — this is known as near-end listening
        enhancement (NLE). Although, existing NLE techniques are able to greatly increase
        intelligibility in harsh noise environments, in favorable noise conditions
        the intelligibility of speech reaches a ceiling where it cannot be further
        enhanced. Actually, the focus of existing methods solely on improving the
        intelligibility causes unnecessary processing of the speech signal and leads
        to speech distortions and quality degradations. In this paper, we provide
        a new rationale for NLE, where the target speech is minimally processed in
        terms of a processing penalty, provided that a certain performance constraint,
        e.g., intelligibility, is …

    fugL2E8AAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C:
      abstract: We consider speech enhancement for signals picked up in one noisy
        environment that must be rendered to a listener in another noisy environment.
        For both far-end noise reduction and near-end listening enhancement, it has
        been shown that excessive focus on noise suppression or intelligibility maximization
        may lead to excessive speech distortions and quality degradations in favorable
        noise conditions, where intelligibility is already at ceiling level. Recently
        [1,2] propose to remedy this with a minimum processing framework that either
        reduces noise or enhances listening a minimum amount given that a certain
        intelligibility criterion is still satisfied. Additionally, it has been shown
        that joint consideration of both environments improves speech enhancement
        performance. In this paper, we formulate a joint far- and near-end minimum
        processing framework, that improves intelligibility while limiting speech
        distortions in favorable noise conditions. We provide closed-form solutions
        to specific boundary scenarios and investigate performance for the general
        case using numerical optimization. We also show that concatenating existing
        minimum processing far- and near-end enhancement methods preserves the effects
        of the initial methods. Results show that the joint optimization can further
        improve performance compared to the concatenated approach.

      abstract: Deep representation learning has gained significant momentum in advancing
        text-dependent speaker verification (TD-SV) systems. When designing deep neural
        networks (DNN) for extracting bottleneck (BN) features, the key considerations
        include training targets, activation functions, and loss functions. In this
        paper, we systematically study the impact of these choices on the performance
        of TD-SV. For training targets, we consider speaker identity, time-contrastive
        learning (TCL), and auto-regressive prediction coding, with the first being
        supervised and the last two being self-supervised. Furthermore, we study a
        range of loss functions when speaker identity is used as the training target.
        With regard to activation functions, we study the widely used sigmoid function,
        rectified linear unit (ReLU), and Gaussian error linear unit (GELU). We experimentally
        show that GELU is able to reduce the error rates of TD-SV significantly compared
        to sigmoid, irrespective of the training target. Among the three training
        targets, TCL performs the best. Among the various loss functions, cross-entropy,
        joint-softmax, and focal loss functions outperform the others. Finally, the
        score-level fusion of different systems is also able to reduce the error rates.
        To evaluate the representation learning methods, experiments are conducted
        on the RedDots 2016 challenge database consisting of short utterances for
        TD-SV systems based on classic Gaussian mixture model-universal background
        model (GMM-UBM) and i-vector methods.

        a challenging task, and speech enhancement (SE) is one of the effective techniques
        to solve the problem. Motivated by the promising results of generative adversarial
        networks (GANs) in a variety of image processing tasks, we explore the potential
        of conditional GANs (cGANs) for SE, and in particular, we make use of the
        image processing framework proposed by Isola et al. [1] to learn a mapping
        from the spectrogram of noisy speech to an enhanced counterpart. The SE cGAN
        consists of two networks, trained in an adversarial manner: a generator that
        tries to enhance the input noisy spectrogram, and a discriminator that tries
        to distinguish between enhanced spectrograms provided by the generator and
        clean ones from the database using the noisy spectrogram as a condition. We
        evaluate the performance of the cGAN method in terms of perceptual evaluation
        of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and
        equal error rate (EER) of speaker verification (an example application). Experimental
        results show that the cGAN method overall outperforms the classical short-time

      abstract: In this paper, we propose the utterance-level permutation invariant
        training (uPIT) technique. uPIT is a practically applicable, end-to-end, deep-learning-based
        solution for speaker independent multitalker speech separation. Specifically,
        uPIT extends the recently proposed permutation invariant training (PIT) technique
        with an utterance-level cost function, hence eliminating the need for solving
        an additional permutation problem during inference, which is otherwise required
        by frame-level PIT. We achieve this using recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
        that, during training, minimize the utterance-level separation error, hence
        forcing separated frames belonging to the same speaker to be aligned to the
        same output stream. In practice, this allows RNNs, trained with uPIT, to separate
        multitalker mixed speech without any prior knowledge of signal duration, number
        of speakers, speaker identity, or gender. We evaluated uPIT …

      abstract: Speech enhancement  and  speech separation  are two related tasks,
        whose purpose is to extract either one or more target speech signals, respectively,
        from a mixture of sounds generated by several sources. Traditionally, these
        tasks have been tackled using signal processing and machine learning techniques
        applied to the available acoustic signals. Since the visual aspect of speech
        is essentially unaffected by the acoustic environment,  visual information  from
        the target speakers, such as lip movements and facial expressions, has also
        been used for speech enhancement and speech separation systems. In order to
        efficiently fuse acoustic and visual information, researchers have exploited
        the flexibility of data-driven approaches, specifically  deep learning , achieving
        strong performance. The ceaseless proposal of a large number of techniques
        to extract features and fuse multimodal information has highlighted …

      abstract: 'Audio captioning aims at describing the content of audio clips with
        human language. Due to the ambiguity of audio content, different people may
        perceive the same audio clip differently, resulting in caption disparities
        ( i.e. , the same audio clip may be described by several captions with diverse
        semantics). In the literature, the one-to-many strategy is often employed
        to train the audio captioning models, where a related caption is randomly
        selected as the optimization target for each audio clip at each training iteration.
        However, we observe that this can lead to significant variations during the
        optimization process and adversely affect the performance of the model. In

      abstract: The study of intelligence oversight captures the inherently political
        nature of secret intelligence. However, many studies of intelligence oversight
        adopt rather instrumentalist views that omit important political aspects of
        the policy process. Typically, these studies focus on obstacles to effective
        oversight. This article discusses how the effectiveness of oversight can be
        assessed by applying broad evaluative categories that contain programmatic,
        process-related, political, and durability dimensions. Empirically, the study
        probes the case of Sweden as an illustration. Swedish oversight arrangements
        have on balance been successful in some dimensions, particularly the programmatic
        dimension, which arguably also contributed to its relative longevity.

      abstract: Context is a key issue in interaction between human and computer,
        describing the surrounding facts that add meaning. In mobile computing location
        is usually used to approximate context and to implement context-aware applications.
        We propose that ultra-mobile computing, characterized by devices that are

        computers), can significantly benefit from a wider notion of context. To structure

        orientation-aware PDA interface. The concept is then extended to a model for
        sensor fusion to enable more sophisticated context …

        connected to everything. However, for successful applications to emerge, it
        will not be the quantity but the quality and usefulness of connections that
        will matter. Our concern is how qualitative relations and more selective connections
        can be established between smart artefacts, and how users can retain control
        over artefact interconnection. We propose context proximity for selective
        artefact communication, using the context of artefacts for matchmaking. We
        further suggest to empower users with simple but effective means to impose
        the same context on a number of artefacts. To prove our point we have implemented
        Smart-Its Friends, small embedded devices that become connected when a user
        holds them together and shakes them.

      abstract: 'Gaze-Hand Alignment has recently been proposed for multimodal selection
        in 3D. The technique takes advantage of gaze for target pre-selection, as
        it naturally precedes manual input. Selection is then completed when manual
        input aligns with gaze on the target, without need for an additional click
        method. In this work we evaluate two alignment techniques, Gaze&Finger and
        Gaze&Handray, combining gaze with image plane pointing versus raycasting,
        in comparison with hands-only baselines and Gaze&Pinch as established multimodal
        technique. We used Fitts’ Law study design with targets presented at different
        depths in the visual scene, to assess effect of parallax on performance. The
        alignment techniques outperformed their respective hands-only baselines. Gaze&Finger
        is efficient when targets are close to the image plane but less performant
        with increasing target depth due to parallax. '

        moving aerial photography controlled by the distribution of weight on its
        surface. It was designed to investigate our ideas about how technologies for
        the home could support ludic activities-that is, activities motivated by curiosity,
        exploration, and reflection rather than externally-defined tasks. The many
        design choices we made, for example to block or disguise utilitarian functionality,
        helped to articulate our emerging understanding of ludic design. Observations
        of the Drift Table being used in volunteers' homes over several weeks gave
        greater insight into how playful exploration is practically achieved and the
        issues involved in designing for ludic engagement.

      abstract: This paper presents a head-mounted virtual reality study that compared
        gaze, head, and controller pointing for selection of dynamically revealed
        targets. Existing studies on head-mounted 3D interaction have focused on pointing
        and selection tasks where all targets are visible to the user. Our study compared
        the effects of screen width (field of view), target amplitude and width, and
        prior knowledge of target location on modality performance. Results show that
        gaze and controller pointing are significantly faster than head pointing and
        that increased screen width only positively impacts performance up to a certain
        point. We further investigated the applicability of existing pointing models.
        Our analysis confirmed the suitability of previously proposed two-component
        models for all modalities while uncovering differences for gaze at known and
        unknown target positions. Our findings provide new empirical evidence for
        understanding input with gaze, head, and controller and are significant for
        applications that extend around the user.

      abstract: ' As eye tracking in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) becomes
        established, it will be used by broader demographics, increasing the likelihood
        of tracking errors. Therefore, it is important when designing eye tracking
        applications or interaction techniques to test them at different signal quality
        levels to ensure they function for as many people as possible. We present
        GE-Simulator, a novel open-source Unity toolkit that allows the simulation
        of accuracy, precision, and data loss errors during real-time usage by adding
        gaze vector errors into the gaze vector from the head-mounted AR/VR eye tracker.
        The tool is customisable without having to change the source code and changes
        in eye tracking errors during and in-between usage. Our toolkit allows designers
        to prototype new applications at different levels of eye tracking in the early
        phases of design and can be used to evaluate techniques with users at varying

      abstract: The use of context in mobile devices is receiving increasing attention
        in mobile and ubiquitous computing research. In this article we consider how
        to augment mobile devices with awareness of their environment and situation
        as context. Most work to date has been based on integration of generic context
        sensors, in particular for location and visual context. We propose a different
        approach based on integration of multiple diverse sensors for awareness of
        situational context that can not be inferred from location, and targeted at
        mobile device platforms that typically do not permit processing of visual
        context. We have investigated multi-sensor context-awareness in a series of
        projects, and report experience from development of a number of device prototypes.
        These include development of an awareness module for augmentation of a mobile

        This article offers a novel framework to understand how business organizations

      abstract: Graph-based reasoning over skeleton data has emerged as a promising
        approach for human action recognition. However, the application of prior graph-based
        methods, which predominantly employ whole temporal sequences as their input,
        to the setting of online inference entails considerable computational redundancy.
        In this paper, we tackle this issue by reformulating the Spatio-Temporal Graph
        Convolutional Neural Network as a Continual Inference Network, which can perform
        step-by-step predictions in time without repeat frame processing. To evaluate
        our method, we create a continual version of ST-GCN, CoST-GCN, alongside two
        derived methods with different self-attention mechanisms, CoAGCN and CoS-TR.

        for inference acceleration, and perform experiments on the NTU RGB+ D 60,

        We address this gap by developing a tool, which ranks investors based on their

        of retail investors based on their social connections in an insider network.
        Particularly, the high predictability of the investor’s trading behavior with
        data on her/his social neighborhood can indicate that she/he takes advantage
        of her/his social connections and trades on non-public information. Our system

        entirety by electronic means and the largest fraction of them is completely
        automated, an opportunity has risen from analyzing this vast amount of transactions.

        Being able to detect them in advance, allows them to take profitable positions
        or avoid anomalous events in the financial markets. In this work we proposed
        a deep learning methodology, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),

      abstract: Forecasting financial time-series has long been among the most challenging
        problems in financial market analysis. In order to recognize the correct circumstances
        to enter or exit the markets investors usually employ statistical models (or
        even simple qualitative methods). However, the inherently noisy and stochastic
        nature of markets severely limits the forecasting accuracy of the used models.
        The introduction of electronic trading and the availability of large amounts
        of data allow for developing novel machine learning techniques that address
        some of the difficulties faced by the aforementioned methods. In this work
        we propose a deep learning methodology, based on recurrent neural networks,
        that can be used for predicting future price movements from large-scale high-frequency
        time-series data on Limit Order Books. The proposed method is evaluated using
        a large-scale dataset of limit order book events.

      abstract: Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest
        that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from
        a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent
        of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study,
        and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances
        in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this
        global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously,
        and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and
        seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured
        by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning

        of the ELM kernel matrix for two of the most common activation functions,
        i.e., the RBF and the sigmoid functions. In addition, we show that a low-rank
        decomposition of the kernel matrix defined on the input training data can
        be exploited in order to determine an appropriate ELM space for input data
        mapping. The ELM space determined from this process can be subsequently used
        for network training using the original ELM formulation. Experimental results
        denote that the adoption of the low-rank decomposition-based ELM space determination
        leads to enhanced performance, when compared to the standard choice, i.e.,
        random input weights generation.

        because of the inherently noisy and stochastic nature of the market. In the
        high-frequency trading, forecasting for trading purposes is even a more challenging
        task, since an automated inference system is required to be both accurate

        that enables the layer to detect and focus on crucial temporal information.
        The resulting network is highly interpretable, given its ability to highlight

      abstract: As the size and complexity of models and datasets grow, so does the
        need for communicatione fficient variants of stochastic gradient descent that
        can be deployed to perform parallel model training. One popular communication-compression
        method for data-parallel SGD is QSGD (Alistarh et al., 2017), which quantizes
        and encodes gradients to reduce communication costs. The baseline variant
        of QSGD provides strong theoretical guarantees, however, for practical purposes,
        the authors proposed a heuristic variant which we call QSGDinf, which demonstrated
        impressive empirical gains for distributed training of large neural networks.
        In this paper, we build on this work to propose a new gradient quantization
        scheme, and show that it has both stronger theoretical guarantees than QSGD,
        and matches and exceeds the empirical performance of the QSGDinf heuristic
        and of other compression methods.

      abstract: Implementations of SGD on distributed and multi-GPU systems creates
        new vulnerabilities, which can be identified and misused by one or more adversarial
        agents. Recently, it has been shown that well-known Byzantine-resilient gradient
        aggregation schemes are indeed vulnerable to informed attackers that can tailor
        the attacks (Fang et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020b). We introduce MixTailor,
        a scheme based on randomization of the aggregation strategies that makes it
        impossible for the attacker to be fully informed. Deterministic schemes can
        be integrated into MixTailor on the fly without introducing any additional
        hyperparameters. Randomization decreases the capability of a powerful adversary
        to tailor its attacks, while the resulting randomized aggregation scheme is
        still competitive in terms of performance. For both iid and non-iid settings,
        we establish almost sure convergence guarantees that are both stronger and
        more general than those available in the literature. Our empirical studies
        across various datasets, attacks, and settings, validate our hypothesis and
        show that MixTailor successfully defends when well-known Byzantine-tolerant
        schemes fail.

      abstract: Covariate shift across clients is a major challenge for federated
        learning (FL). This work studies the generalization properties of FL under
        intra-client and inter-client covariate shifts. To this end, we propose Federated
        Importance-weighteD Empirical risk Minimization (FIDEM) to optimize a global
        FL model, along with new variants of density ratio matching methods, aiming
        to handle covariate shifts. These methods trade off some level of privacy
        for improving the overall generalization performance. We theoretically show
        that FIDEM achieves smaller generalization error than classical empirical
        risk minimization under some certain settings. Experimental results demonstrate
        the superiority of FIDEM over federated averaging (McMahan et al., 2017)  and
        other baselines, which would open the door to study FL under distribution
        shifts more systematically.

        settings where multiple processors/workers/clients have access to local stochastic

        distributed convex minimization to min-max and games. Extra-gradient, which
        is a de facto algorithm for monotone VI problems, has not been designed to

        extra-gradient (Q-GenX), which is an unbiased and adaptive compression method
        tailored to solve VIs. We provide an adaptive step-size rule, which adapts
        to the respective noise profiles at hand and achieve a fast rate of O (1/T)
        under relative noise, and an orderoptimal O (1/√ T) under absolute noise and

        adversarial networks on multiple GPUs.

      abstract: Well-known robust aggregation schemes in federated learning (FL) are
        shown to be vulnerable to an informed adversary who can tailor training-time
        attacks [Fang et al., Xie et al.]. We frame robust distributed learning problem
        as a game between a server and an adversary that is able to optimize strong
        training-time attacks. We introduce RobustTailor, a simulation-based framework
        that prevents the adversary from being omniscient. The simulated game we propose
        enjoys theoretical guarantees through a regret analysis. RobustTailor improves
        robustness to training-time attacks significantly while preserving almost
        the same privacy guarantees as standard robust aggregation schemes in FL.
        Empirical results under challenging attacks show that RobustTailor performs
        similar to an upper bound with perfect knowledge of honest clients.

      abstract: Many communication-efficient variants of SGD use gradient quantization
        schemes. These schemes are often heuristic and fixed over the course of training.
        We empirically observe that the statistics of gradients of deep models change
        during the training. Motivated by this observation, we introduce two adaptive
        quantization schemes, ALQ and AMQ. In both schemes, processors update their
        compression schemes in parallel by efficiently computing sufficient statistics
        of a parametric distribution. We improve the validation accuracy by almost
        2% on CIFAR-10 and 1% on ImageNet in challenging low-cost communication setups.
        Our adaptive methods are also significantly more robust to the choice of hyperparameters.

      abstract: While momentum-based methods, in conjunction with stochastic gradient
        descent (SGD), are widely used when training machine learning models, there
        is little theoretical understanding on the generalization error of such methods.
        In this work, we first show that there exists a convex loss function for which
        the stability gap for multiple epochs of SGD with standard heavy-ball momentum
        (SGDM) becomes unbounded. Then, for smooth Lipschitz loss functions, we analyze
        a modified momentum-based update rule, i.e., SGD with early momentum (SGDEM),
        and show that it admits an upper-bound on the generalization error. Thus,
        our results show that machine learning models can be trained for multiple
        epochs of SGDEM with a guarantee for generalization. Finally, for the special
        case of strongly convex loss functions, we find a range of momentum such that
        multiple epochs of standard SGDM, as a special form of SGDEM, also generalizes.
        Extending our results on generalization, we also develop an upper-bound on
        the expected true risk, in terms of the number of training steps, the size
        of the training set, and the momentum parameter. Our experimental evaluations
        verify the consistency between the numerical results and our theoretical bounds.
        SGDEM improves the generalization error of SGDM when training ResNet-18 on
        ImageNet in practical distributed settings.

        linear radiation and diffraction problem for floating offshore structures.
        We present a solution to a pseudo-impulsive formulation in the time domain,
        where the frequency-dependent quantities, such as added mass, radiation damping,
        and wave excitation force for arbitrary heading angle, , are evaluated using
        Fourier transforms from the tailored time-domain responses. The spatial domain
        is tessellated by an unstructured high-order hybrid configured mesh and represented
        by piece-wise polynomial basis functions in the spectral element space. Fourth-order
        accurate time integration is employed through an explicit four-stage Runge-Kutta
        method and complemented by fourth-order finite difference approximations for
        time differentiation. To reduce the computational burden, the model can make
        use of symmetry boundaries in the domain representation. The key piece of
        the numerical model -- the discrete Laplace solver -- is validated through
        - and -convergence studies. Moreover, to highlight the capabilities of the
        proposed model, we present prof-of-concept examples of simple floating bodies
        (a sphere and a box). Lastly, a much more involved case is performed of an
        oscillating water column, including generalized modes resembling the piston
        motion and wave sloshing effects inside the wave energy converter chamber.
        In this case, the spectral element model trivially computes the infinite-frequency
        added mass, which is a singular problem for conventional boundary element
        type solvers.

      abstract: We address the challenge of sound propagation simulations in D virtual
        rooms with moving sources, which have applications in virtual/augmented reality,
        game audio, and spatial computing. Solutions to the wave equation can describe
        wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference. However, simulating them
        using conventional numerical discretization methods with hundreds of source
        and receiver positions is intractable, making stimulating a sound field with
        moving sources impractical. To overcome this limitation, we propose using
        deep operator networks to approximate linear wave-equation operators. This
        enables the rapid prediction of sound propagation in realistic 3D acoustic
        scenes with moving sources, achieving millisecond-scale computations. By learning
        a compact surrogate model, we avoid the offline calculation and storage of
        impulse responses for all relevant source/listener pairs. Our experiments,
        including various complex scene geometries, show good agreement with reference
        solutions, with root mean squared errors ranging from 0.02 Pa to 0.10 Pa.
        Notably, our method signifies a paradigm shift as no prior machine learning
        approach has achieved precise predictions of complete wave fields within realistic

      abstract: State-space search is paramount for intelligent decision making when
        long-term thinking is needed. We introduce dominance and contrastive analysis
        methods, which enable reasoning about the relative advantages among different
        courses of action. This re-shapes how agents reason and leads to new families
        of state-space search algorithms.

      abstract: 'Testing is a promising way to gain trust in learned action policies
        π. Prior work on action-policy testing in AI planning formalized bugs as states
        t where π is sub-optimal with respect to a given testing objective. Deciding
        whether or not t is a bug is as hard as (optimal) planning itself. How can
        we design test oracles able to recognize some states t to be bugs efficiently?
        Recent work introduced metamorphic oracles which compare policy behavior on
        state pairs (s, t) where t is easier to solve; if π performs worse on t than
        on s, we know that t is a bug. Here, we show how to automatically design such
        oracles in classical planning, based on simulation relations between states.
        We introduce two oracle families of this kind: first, morphing query states
        t to obtain suitable s; second, maintaining and comparing upper bounds on
        h* across the states encountered during testing. Our experiments on ASNet
        policies show that these oracles can find bugs much more quickly than the
        existing alternatives, which are search-based; and that the combination of
        our oracles with search-based ones almost consistently dominates all other
        oracles.'

      abstract: A popular approach for sequential decision-making is to perform simulator-based
        search guided with Machine Learning (ML) methods like policy learning. On
        the other hand, model-relaxation heuristics can guide the search effectively
        if a full declarative model is available. In this work, we consider how a
        practitioner can improve ML-based black-box planning on settings where a complete
        symbolic model is not available. We show that specifying an incomplete STRIPS
        model that describes only part of the problem enables the use of relaxation
        heuristics. Our findings on several planning domains suggest that this is
        an effective way to improve ML-based black-box planning beyond collecting
        more data or tuning ML architectures.

      abstract: Lately, several important advancements have been obtained in symbolic
        search. First, bidirectional blind search has obtained good results on many
        domains. Second, perimeter-based abstraction heuristics have been proposed
        as an important improvement over regular abstraction heuristics. Motivated
        by the synergy between bidirectional search and perimeter-based abstraction
        heuristics, here we present SymBA*, which performs bidirectional A* using
        the frontiers of the opposite search to infer informed perimeter-based abstraction
        heuristics.

      abstract: on heuristics are a state-of-the-art technique to solve classical
        planning problems optimally. A common approach is to precompute many small
        abstractions and combine them admissibly using cost partitioning. Recent work
        has shown that this approach does not work out well when using such heuristics
        for decoupled state space search, where search nodes represent potentially
        large sets of states. This is due to the fact that admissibly combining the
        estimates of several heuristics without sacrificing accuracy is NP-hard for
        decoupled states. In this work we propose to use a single large abstraction
        instead. We focus on merge-and-shrink and symbolic pattern database heuristics,
        which are designed to produce such abstractions. For these heuristics, we
        prove that the evaluation of decoupled states is NP-hard in general, but we
        also identify conditions under which it is polynomial. We introduce algorithms
        for both the general and the polynomial case. Our experimental evaluation
        shows that single large abstraction heuristics lead to strong performance
        when the heuristic evaluation is polynomial.

      abstract: Research on heuristic functions is all about estimating the length
        (or cost) of solution paths. But what if there is no such path? Many known
        heuristics have the ability to detect (some) unsolvable states, but that ability
        has always been treated as a by-product. No attempt has been made to design
        heuristics specifically for that purpose, where there is no need to preserve
        distances. As a case study towards leveraging that advantage, we investigate
        merge-and-shrink abstractions in classical planning. We identify safe abstraction
        steps (no information loss regarding solvability) that would not be safe for
        traditional heuristics. We design practical algorithm configurations, and
        run extensive experiments showing that our heuristics outperform the state
        of the art for proving planning tasks unsolvable.

      abstract: In cost-optimal planning we aim to find a sequence of operators that
        achieve a set of goals with minimum cost. Symbolic search with Binary Decision
        Diagrams (BDDs) performs efficient state space exploration in terms of time
        and memory. This is crucial in optimal settings, in which large parts of the
        state space must be explored in order to prove optimality. However, the development
        of accurate heuristics for explicit-state search in recent years have left
        symbolic search techniques in a secondary place. In this article we propose
        two orthogonal improvements for symbolic search planning. On the one hand,
        we analyze and compare different methods for image computation in order to
        efficiently perform the successor generation on symbolic search. Image computation
        is the main bottleneck of symbolic search algorithms so an efficient computation
        is paramount for efficient symbolic search planning. On the other hand …

      abstract: 'The merge-and-shrink framework is a powerful tool to construct state
        space abstractions based on factored representations. One of its core applications
        in classical planning is the construction of admissible abstraction heuristics.
        In this paper, we develop a compositional theory of merge-and-shrink in the
        context of probabilistic planning, focusing on stochastic shortest path problems
        (SSPs). As the basis for this development, we contribute a novel factored
        state space model for SSPs. We show how general transformations, including
        abstractions, can be formulated on this model to derive admissible and/or
        perfect heuristics. To formalize the mergeand-shrink framework for SSPs, we
        transfer the fundamental merge-and-shrink transformations from the classical
        setting: shrinking, merging, and label reduction. We analyze the formal properties
        of these transformations in detail and show how the conditions under which
        shrinking and label reduction lead to perfect heuristics can be extended to
        the SSP setting.'

      abstract: When dealing with transportation problems Operational Research (OR),
        and related areas as Artificial Intelligence (AI), have focused mostly on
        uni-modal transport problems. Due to the current existence of bigger international
        logistics companies, transportation problems are becoming increasingly more
        complex. One of the complexities arises from the use of intermodal transportation.
        Intermodal transportation reflects the combination of at least two modes of
        transport in a single transport chain, without a change of container for the
        goods. In this paper, a new hybrid approach is described which addresses complex
        intermodal transport problems. It combines OR techniques with AI search methods
        in order to obtain good quality solutions, by exploiting the benefits of both
        kinds of techniques. The solution has been applied to a real world problem

        In case one robot breaks down, another robot can take steps to repair the
        failed robot or take over the failed robot's task. Although fault tolerance
        and robustness to individual failures have often been central arguments in

      abstract: Swarm robotics is a promising approach for the coordination of large
        numbers of robots. While previous studies have shown that evolutionary robotics
        techniques can be applied to obtain robust and efficient self-organized behaviors
        for robot swarms, most studies have been conducted in simulation, and the
        few that have been conducted on real robots have been confined to laboratory
        environments. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a swarm robotics
        system with evolved control successfully operating in a real and uncontrolled
        environment. We evolve neural network-based controllers in simulation for
        canonical swarm robotics tasks, namely homing, dispersion, clustering, and
        monitoring. We then assess the performance of the controllers on a real swarm
        of up to ten aquatic surface robots. Our results show that the evolved controllers
        transfer successfully to real robots and achieve a performance similar to
        the performance obtained in simulation. We validate that the evolved controllers
        display key properties of swarm intelligence-based control, namely scalability,
        flexibility, and robustness on the real swarm. We conclude with a proof-of-concept
        experiment in which the swarm performs a complete environmental monitoring
        task by combining multiple evolved controllers.

        human-like inferential semantics and world knowledge. Knowledge bases such
        as WikiData provide large-scale, high-quality representations of inferential
        semantics and world knowledge. We show that large language models learn to
        organize concepts in ways that are strikingly similar to how concepts are
        organized in such knowledge bases. Knowledge bases model collective, institutional
        knowledge, and large language models seem to induce such knowledge from raw
        text. We show that bigger and better models exhibit more human-like concept
        organization, across four families of language models and three knowledge
        graph embeddings.

      abstract: Cross-lingual representations of words enable us to reason about word
        meaning in multilingual contexts and are a key facilitator of cross-lingual
        transfer when developing natural language processing models for low-resource
        languages. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive typology of cross-lingual
        word embedding models. We compare their data requirements and objective functions.
        The recurring theme of the survey is that many of the models presented in
        the literature optimize for the same objectives, and that seemingly different
        models are often equivalent, modulo optimization strategies, hyper-parameters,
        and such. We also discuss the different ways cross-lingual word embeddings
        are evaluated, as well as future challenges and research horizons.

      abstract: One of the greatest puzzles of all time is how understanding arises
        from neural mechanics. Our brains are networks of billions of biological neurons
        transmitting chemical and electrical signals along their connections. Large
        language models are networks of millions or billions of digital neurons, implementing
        functions that read the output of other functions in complex networks. The
        failure to see how meaning would arise from such mechanics has led many cognitive
        scientists and philosophers to various forms of dualism -- and many artificial
        intelligence researchers to dismiss large language models as stochastic parrots
        or jpeg-like compressions of text corpora. We show that human-like representations
        arise in large language models. Specifically, the larger neural language models
        get, the more their representations are structurally similar to neural response
        measurements from brain imaging.

        Brain and language model activations exhibit some structural similarities,
        enabling linear partial mappings between features extracted from neural recordings
        and computational language models. In an attempt to evaluate how much evidence
        has been accumulated for this observation, we survey over 30 studies spanning
        10 datasets and 8 metrics. How much evidence has been accumulated, and what,
        if anything, is missing before we can draw conclusions? Our analysis of the
        evaluation methods used in the literature reveals that some of the metrics
        are less conservative. We also find that the accumulated evidence, for now,
        remains ambiguous, but correlations with model size and quality provide grounds
        for cautious optimism.'

      abstract: In all previous work on deep multi-task learning we are aware of,
        all task supervisions are on the same (outermost) layer. We present a multi-task
        learning architecture with deep bi-directional RNNs, where different tasks
        supervision can happen at different layers. We present experiments in syntactic
        chunking and CCG supertagging, coupled with the additional task of POS-tagging.
        We show that it is consistently better to have POS supervision at the innermost
        rather than the outermost layer. We argue that this is because “lowlevel”
        tasks are better kept at the lower layers, enabling the higher-level tasks
        to make use of the shared representation of the lower-level tasks. Finally,
        we also show how this architecture can be used for domain adaptation.

      abstract: Language models such as mBERT, XLM-R, and BLOOM aim to achieve multilingual
        generalization or compression to facilitate transfer to a large number of
        (potentially unseen) languages. However, these models should ideally also
        be private, linguistically fair, and transparent, by relating their predictions
        to training data. Can these requirements be simultaneously satisfied? We show
        that multilingual compression and linguistic fairness are compatible with
        differential privacy, but that differential privacy is at odds with training
        data influence sparsity, an objective for transparency. We further present
        a series of experiments on two common NLP tasks and evaluate multilingual
        compression and training data influence sparsity under different privacy guarantees,
        exploring these trade-offs in more detail. Our results suggest that we need
        to develop ways to jointly optimize for these objectives in order to find
        practical trade-offs.

      abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) allows deep neural networks to learn from
        related tasks by sharing parameters with other networks. In practice, however,
        MTL involves searching an enormous space of possible parameter sharing architectures
        to find (a) the layers or subspaces that benefit from sharing,(b) the appropriate
        amount of sharing, and (c) the appropriate relative weights of the different
        task losses. Recent work has addressed each of the above problems in isolation.
        In this work we present an approach that learns a latent multi-task architecture
        that jointly addresses (a)–(c). We present experiments on synthetic data and
        data from OntoNotes 5.0, including four different tasks and seven different
        domains. Our extension consistently outperforms previous approaches to learning
        latent architectures for multi-task problems and achieves up to 15% average
        error reductions over common approaches to MTL.

      abstract: Bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks have recently
        proven successful for various NLP sequence modeling tasks, but little is known
        about their reliance to input representations, target languages, data set
        size, and label noise. We address these issues and evaluate bi-LSTMs with
        word, character, and unicode byte embeddings for POS tagging. We compare bi-LSTMs
        to traditional POS taggers across languages and data sizes. We also present
        a novel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with an
        auxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The model obtains state-of-the-art
        performance across 22 languages, and works especially well for morphologically
        complex languages. Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are less sensitive
        to training data size and label corruptions (at small noise levels) than previously
        assumed.

      abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is central for remote sensing, and much research
        has been done on analysis methods for land surveillance using space- and air-borne
        imaging systems. Proximal hyperspectral imaging is also widely used in plant
        and agriculture science. It allows the remote capturing of leaf reflectance
        information in order to determine and classify plant health and disease. With
        the high information density in hyperspectral images, it becomes increasingly
        important to apply sophisticated feature extraction in order to reduce image
        dimensionality while retaining useful information. Autoencoders are one of
        the primary methods for deep learning-based feature extraction in hyperspectral
        images. We investigate different setups of autoencoders to encode the spatial
        and spectral dimensions in different orders and ways. To our surprise, the

      abstract: Progress in 3D volumetric image analysis research is limited by the
        lack of datasets and most advances in analysis methods for volumetric images
        are based on medical data. However, medical data do not necessarily resemble
        the characteristics of other volumetric images such as micro-CT. To promote
        research in 3D volumetric image analysis beyond medical data, we have created
        the BugNIST dataset and made it freely available. BugNIST is an extensive
        dataset of micro-CT scans of 12 types of bugs, such as insects and larvae.
        BugNIST contains 9437 volumes where 9087 are of individual bugs and 350 are
        mixtures of bugs and other material. The goal of BugNIST is to benchmark classification
        and detection methods, and we have designed the detection challenge such that
        detection models are trained on scans of individual bugs and tested on bug
        mixtures. Models capable of solving this task will be independent of the context,
        i.e., the surrounding material. This is a great advantage if the context is
        unknown or changing, as is often the case in micro-CT. Our initial baseline
        analysis shows that current state-of-the-art deep learning methods classify
        individual bugs very well, but has great difficulty with the detection challenge.
        Hereby, BugNIST enables research in image analysis areas that until now have
        missed relevant data - both classification, detection, and hopefully more.

      abstract: The seminal multiple view stereo benchmark evaluations from Middlebury
        and by Strecha et al. have played a major role in propelling the development
        of multi-view stereopsis methodology. Although seminal, these benchmark datasets
        are limited in scope with few reference scenes. Here, we try to take these
        works a step further by proposing a new multi-view stereo dataset, which is
        an order of magnitude larger in number of scenes and with a significant increase
        in diversity. Specifically, we propose a dataset containing 80 scenes of large
        variability. Each scene consists of 49 or 64 accurate camera positions and
        reference structured light scans, all acquired by a 6-axis industrial robot.
        To apply this dataset we propose an extension of the evaluation protocol from
        the Middlebury evaluation, reflecting the more complex geometry of some of
        our scenes. The proposed dataset is used to evaluate the state of the art
        multiview stereo algorithms of Tola et al., Campbell et al. and Furukawa et
        al. Hereby we demonstrate the usability of the dataset as well as gain insight
        into the workings and challenges of multi-view stereopsis. Through these experiments
        we empirically validate some of the central hypotheses of multi-view stereopsis,
        as well as determining and reaffirming some of the central challenges.

        a positive effect of aerobic exercise on both brain structure and function,
        while the effects of aerobic exercise in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has been
        scarcely investigated.Methods: In a single-blinded randomized MRI study, we
        assessed the effects of an aerobic exercise intervention on brain volume as
        measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its correlation to cognitive
        functioning in patients with AD. The study was a sub-study of a larger randomized
        controlled trial (ADEX study). Forty-one patients were assigned to a control
        or exercise group. The exercise group performed 60-min of aerobic exercise
        three times per week for 16 weeks. All participants underwent whole-brain
        MRI at 3 Tesla and cognitive assessment at baseline and after 16 weeks. Attendance
        and intensity were monitored providing a total exercise load. Changes in regional
        brain volumes and cortical thickness were analyzed using Freesurfer software.Results:
        There was no effect of the type of intervention on MRI-derived brain volumes.
        In the entire group with and without training, Exercise load showed a positive
        correlation with changes in volume in the hippocampus, as well as frontal
        cortical thickness. Volume changes in frontal cortical thickness correlated
        with changes in measures of mental speed and attention and exercise load in
        the exercise group.Conclusion: We did not find evidence to support an effect
        of 16 weeks of aerobic exercise on brain volume changes in patients with AD.

      abstract: Curvilinear structure segmentation is important in medical imaging,
        quantifying structures such as vessels, airways, neurons, or organ boundaries
        in 2D slices. Segmentation via pixel-wise classification often fails to capture
        the small and low-contrast curvilinear structures. Prior topological information
        is typically used to address this problem, often at an expensive computational
        cost, and sometimes requiring prior knowledge of the expected topology.We

        placing the gate at a proper location in the ultrasound image to obtain blood

      abstract: This paper introduces a system to assist golf course raters in determining
        the difficulty rating of a golf hole. Currently, determining the rating of
        a given golf hole relies on time-consuming manual measurements on the ground,
        which we attempt to partially automate. A U-net neural network is trained
        to classify greens, fairways, tees, bunkers, and water in golf courses, and
        a course rating assistance system is implemented to measure distances between
        relevant course parts. Since no public datasets containing golf courses existed
        prior to this work, we present a new public data set of golf courses created
        from orthophotos. 1,123 RGB orthophotos for training/validation and 108 RGB
        orthophotos for testing were gathered from 107 Danish golf courses (58% of
        Danish courses) during the spring season and manually annotated. The dataset
        is publicly available on Kaggle1. The U-net model accomplished a mean intersection
        over union (IoU) of 69.6%, mean sensitivity of 78.0%, and mean positive predictive
        value (PPV) of 84.1%. Based on this automatic analysis of the course images,
        the course rating assistance system computes 5 crucial distances for course
        raters to determine a course rating and achieved a mean error of 2.7% and
        17.7% for green length and width, as well as a mean error of 3.3% and 4.2%
        for male/female hole lengths.

      abstract: We propose a fully automatic annotation scheme which takes a raw 3D
        point cloud with a set of fitted CAD models as input, and outputs convincing
        point-wise labels which can be used as cheap training data for point cloud
        segmentation. Compared to manual annotations, we show that our automatic labels
        are accurate while drastically reducing the annotation time, and eliminating
        the need for manual intervention or dataset-specific parameters. Our labeling
        pipeline outputs semantic classes and soft point-wise object scores which
        can either be binarized into standard one-hot-encoded labels, thresholded
        into weak labels with ambiguous points left unlabeled, or used directly as
        soft labels during training. We evaluate the label quality and segmentation
        performance of PointNet++ on a dataset of real industrial point clouds and
        Scan2CAD, a public dataset of indoor scenes. Our results indicate that reducing
        supervision in areas which are more difficult to label automatically is beneficial,
        compared to the conventional approach of naively assigning a hard "best guess"
        label to every point.

      abstract: Detecting pedestrians is still a challenging task for automotive vision
        systems due to the extreme variability of targets, lighting conditions, occlusion,
        and high-speed vehicle motion. Much research has been focused on this problem
        in the last ten years and detectors based on classifiers have gained a special
        place among the different approaches presented. This paper presents a state-of-the-art
        pedestrian detection system based on a two-stage classifier. Candidates are
        extracted with a Haar cascade classifier trained with the Daimler Detection
        Benchmark data set and then validated through a part-based histogram-of-oriented-gradient
        (HOG) classifier with the aim of lowering the number of false positives. The
        surviving candidates are then filtered with feature-based tracking to enhance
        the recognition robustness and improve the results' stability. The system
        has been implemented on a prototype vehicle and offers …

        in traffic light recognition (TLR) research and provides an overview of ongoing
        work. The aim is to elucidate which areas have been thoroughly researched
        and which have not, thereby uncovering opportunities for further improvement.
        An overview of the applied methods and noteworthy contributions from a wide

      abstract: Most existing face image Super‐Resolution (SR) methods assume that
        the Low‐Resolution (LR) images were artificially downsampled from High‐Resolution
        (HR) images with bicubic interpolation. This operation changes the natural
        image characteristics and reduces noise. Hence, SR methods trained on such
        data most often fail to produce good results when applied to real LR images.
        To solve this problem, a novel framework for the generation of realistic LR/HR
        training pairs is proposed. The framework estimates realistic blur kernels,
        noise distributions, and JPEG compression artifacts to generate LR images
        with similar image characteristics as the ones in the source domain. This
        allows to train an SR model using high‐quality face images as Ground‐Truth
        (GT). For better perceptual quality, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
        based SR model is used, where the commonly used VGG‐loss [1] is exchanged

      abstract: In this paper, we introduce RELLISUR, a novel dataset of real low-light
        low-resolution images paired with normal-light high-resolution reference image
        counterparts. With this dataset, we seek to fill the gap between low-light
        image enhancement and low-resolution image enhancement (Super-Resolution (SR))
        which is currently only being addressed separately in the literature, even
        though the visibility of real-world images are often limited by both low-light
        and low-resolution. Part of the reason for this, is the lack of a large-scale
        dataset. To this end, we release a dataset with 12750 paired images of different
        resolutions and degrees of low-light illumination, to facilitate learning
        of deep-learning based models that can perform a direct mapping from degraded
        images with low visibility to sharp and detail rich images of high resolution.
        Additionally, we provide a benchmark of the existing methods for separate
        Low Light Enhancement (LLE) and SR on the proposed dataset along with experiments
        with joint LLE and SR. The latter shows that joint processing results in more
        accurate reconstructions with better perceptual quality compared to sequential
        processing of the images. With this, we confirm that the new RELLISUR dataset
        can be useful for future machine learning research aimed at solving simultaneous
        image LLE and SR.

      abstract: The goal of Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is to reconstruct
        a High-Resolution (HR) version of a degraded Low-Resolution (LR) image. Existing
        Super-Resolution (SR) methods mostly assume that the LR image is a result
        of blurring and downsampling the HR image, while in reality LR images are
        often degraded by additional factors such as low-light, low-contrast, noise,
        and color distortion. Due to this, current State-of-the-Art (SoTA) SR methods
        cannot reconstruct real low-light low-resolution images, and a straightforward
        strategy is, therefore, to first perform Low-Light Enhancement (LLE), followed
        by SR, using dedicated methods for each task. Unfortunately, this approach
        leads to poor performance, which motivates us to propose a method for joint
        LLE and SR. However, since LLE and SR are both ill-posed and ill-conditioned
        inverse problems, the joint reconstruction task becomes highly challenging

      abstract: Thermal cameras are used in various domains where the vision of RGB
        cameras is limited. Thermographic imaging enables the visualizations of objects
        beyond the visible range, which enables its use in many applications like
        autonomous cars, nightly footage, military, or surveillance. However, the
        high cost of manufacturing this type of camera limits the spatial resolution
        that it can provide. Real-World Super-Resolution (RWSR) is a topic that can
        be used to solve this problem by using image processing techniques that enhance
        the quality of a real-world image by reconstructing lost high-frequency information.
        This work adapts an existing RWSR framework that is designed to super-resolve
        real-world RGB images. This framework estimates the degradation parameters
        needed to generate realistic Low-resolution (LR) and High-resolution (HR)

      abstract: Augmenting RGB images with depth information is a well-known method
        to significantly improve the recognition accuracy of object recognition models.
        Another method to improve the performance of visual recognition models is
        ensemble learning. However, this method has not been widely explored in combination
        with deep convolutional neural network based RGB-D object recognition models.
        Hence, in this paper, we form different ensembles of complementary deep convolutional
        neural network models, and show that this can be used to increase the recognition
        performance beyond existing limits. Experiments on the Washington RGB-D Object
        Dataset show that our best performing ensemble improves the recognition performance
        with 0.7% compared to using the baseline model alone.

      abstract: Object recognition is one of the important tasks in computer vision
        which has found enormous applications. Depth modality is proven to provide
        supplementary information to the common RGB modality for objectrecognition.
        In this paper, we propose methods to improve the recognition performance of
        an existing deeplearning based RGB-D object recognition model, namely the
        FusionNet proposed by Eitel et al. First, we showthat encoding the depth values
        as colorized surface normals is beneficial, when the model is initialized
        withweights learned from training on ImageNet data. Additionally, we show
        that the RGB stream of the FusionNetmodel can benefit from using deeper network
        architectures, namely the 16-layered VGGNet, in exchange forthe 8-layered
        CaffeNet. In combination, these changes improves the recognition performance
        with 2.2% incomparison to the original FusionNet, when evaluating on the Washington
        RGB-D Object Dataset.

      abstract: Real-world single image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to enhance the
        resolution and reconstruct High-Resolution (HR) details of real Low-Resolution
        (LR) images. This is different from the traditional SR setting, where the
        LR images are synthetically created, typically with bicubic downsampling.
        As the degradation process for real-world LR images are highly complex, SR
        of such images is much more challenging. Recent promising approaches to solve
        the Real-World Super-Resolution (RWSR) problem include the use of domain adaptation
        to create realistic training pairs, and self-learning based methods which
        learn an image specific SR model at test time. However, as domain adaptation
        is an inherently challenging problem in itself, SR models based solely on
        this approach are limited by the domain gap. In contrast, while self-learning
        based methods remove the need for paired training data by utilizing internal
        information in the LR image, these methods come with the cost of slow prediction
        times. This paper proposes a novel framework, Semantic Segmentation Guided
        Real-World Super-Resolution (SSG-RWSR), which uses an auxiliary semantic segmentation
        network to guide the SR learning. This results in noise-free reconstructions
        with accurate object boundaries, and enables training on real LR images. The
        latter allows our SR network to adapt to the image specific degradations,
        without Ground-Truth (GT) reference images. We support the guidance with domain
        adaptation to faithfully reconstruct realistic textures, and ensure color
        consistency. We evaluate our proposed method on two public available datasets,
        and present State-of-the-Art …

        To understand digital traces generated by individuals, we need to design multidisciplinary
        approaches that combine social and data science. Data and social scientists
        face the challenge of effectively building upon each other’s approaches to
        overcome the limitations inherent in each side. Here, we offer a “data science
        perspective” on the challenges that arise when working to establish this interdisciplinary
        environment. We discuss how we perceive the differences and commonalities
        of the questions we ask to understand digital behaviors (including how we
        answer them), and how our methods may complement each other. Finally, we describe
        what a path toward common ground between these fields looks like when viewed

        about human online interactions and behaviors. A crucial problem is the extraction
        of activity patterns that characterize this type of data, in an interpretable
        way. Here, we leverage the Non-negative Tensor Factorization to detect hidden
        correlated behaviors of playing in a well-known game: League of Legends. To
        this aim, we collect the entire gaming history of a group of about 1000 players,
        which accounts for roughly 100K matches. By applying our framework we are
        able to separate players into different groups. We show that each group exhibits
        similar features and playing strategies, as well as similar temporal trajectories,
        i.e., behavioral progressions over the course of their gaming history. We
        surprisingly discover that playing strategies are stable over time and we

      abstract: 'Solving word analogies became one of the most popular benchmarks
        for word embeddings on the assumption that linear relations between word pairs
        (such as king: man:: woman: queen) are indicative of the quality of the embedding.
        We question this assumption by showing that the information not detected by
        linear offset may still be recoverable by a more sophisticated search method,
        and thus is actually encoded in the embedding. The general problem with linear
        offset is its sensitivity to the idiosyncrasies of individual words. We show
        that simple averaging over multiple word pairs improves over the state-of-the-art.
        A further improvement in accuracy (up to 30% for some embeddings and relations)
        is achieved by combining cosine similarity with an estimation of the extent
        to which a candidate answer belongs to the correct word class. In addition
        to this practical contribution, this work highlights the problem of the interaction
        between word embeddings and analogy retrieval algorithms, and its implications
        for the evaluation of word embeddings and the use of analogies in extrinsic

      abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to perform
        new tasks based on a few demonstrations or natural language instructions.
        While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed
        by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As
        a step towards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a
        176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a collaboration
        of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model
        that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising hundreds of sources
        in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total). We find that BLOOM
        achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks, with stronger
        results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate future
        research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code

      abstract: BERT-based architectures currently give state-of-the-art performance
        on many NLP tasks, but little is known about the exact mechanisms that contribute
        to its success. In the current work, we focus on the interpretation of self-attention,
        which is one of the fundamental underlying components of BERT. Using a subset
        of GLUE tasks and a set of handcrafted features-of-interest, we propose the
        methodology and carry out a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the information
        encoded by the individual BERT's heads. Our findings suggest that there is
        a limited set of attention patterns that are repeated across different heads,
        indicating the overall model overparametrization. While different heads consistently
        use the same attention patterns, they have varying impact on performance across
        different tasks. We show that manually disabling attention in certain heads
        leads to a performance improvement over the regular fine-tuned BERT models.

        that were implemented at ACL’23. This includes work with the goal of improving
        review quality, clearer workflow and decision support for the area chairs,
        as well as our efforts to improve paper-reviewer matching for various kinds
        of non-mainstream NLP work, and improve the overall incentives for all participants
        of the peer review process. We present analysis of the factors affecting peer
        review, identify the most problematic issues that the authors complained about,
        and provide suggestions for the future chairs. We hope that publishing such
        reports would (a) improve transparency in decision-making,(b) help the people
        new to the field to understand how the* ACL conferences work,(c) provide useful
        data for the future chairs and workshop organizers, and also academic work
        on peer review, and (d) provide useful context for the final program, as a
        source of information for meta-research on the structure and trajectory of
        the field of NLP.

        Computational Linguistics! The conference will be held in Toronto, Canada,
        July 9-14, 2023. Following the succession of the recent conferences in our
        field, ACL 2023 will adopt a hybrid format. While the impact of Covid has
        considerably diminished in terms of traveling, obtaining visas to Canada entails
        a very long process. Moreover, the global economic conditions pose challenges
        for many individuals to travel to conferences. Recognizing these circumstances,
        we know many participants may not be able to attend the conference in person.
        Therefore, we are committed to providing a great virtual platform so everyone
        has the opportunity to interact with other participants and enjoy the conference.
        Based on the current registered participants, approxiately 30% have chosen
        to attend the conference virtually. Whether you join us in person or virtually,
        we sincerely hope everyone has a remarkable conference experience.

      abstract: In contrast to training traditional machine learning (ML) models in
        data centers, federated learning (FL) trains ML models over local datasets
        contained on resourceconstrained heterogeneous edge devices. Existing FL algorithms
        aim to learn a single global model for all participating devices, which may
        not be helpful to all devices participating in the training due to the heterogeneity
        of the data across the devices. Recently, Hanzely and Richtárik (2020) proposed
        a new formulation for training personalized FL models aimed at balancing the
        trade-off between the traditional global model and the local models that could
        be trained by individual devices using their private data only. They derived
        a new algorithm, called loopless gradient descent (L2GD), to solve it and
        showed that this algorithms leads to improved communication complexity guarantees
        in regimes when more personalization is required. In this paper, we equip
        their L2GD algorithm with a bidirectional compression mechanism to further
        reduce the communication bottleneck between the local devices and the server.
        Unlike other compression-based algorithms used in the FL-setting, our compressed
        L2GD algorithm operates on a probabilistic communication protocol, where communication
        does not happen on a fixed schedule. Moreover, our compressed L2GD algorithm
        maintains a similar convergence rate as vanilla SGD without compression. To
        empirically validate the efficiency of our algorithm, we perform diverse numerical
        experiments on both convex and non-convex problems and using various compression
        techniques.

        effective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operational
        errors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomized
        Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterative
        solver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisy
        regime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand side vector,
        . Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; the coefficient
        matrix  can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of RK
        for noisy linear systems when the coefficient matrix, , is corrupted with
        both additive and multiplicative noise, along with the noisy vector, . In

      abstract: Gradient compression is a widely-established remedy to tackle the
        communication bottleneck in distributed training of large deep neural networks
        (DNNs). Under the error-feedback framework, Top- sparsification, sometimes
        with  as little as 0.1% of the gradient size, enables training to the same
        model quality as the uncompressed case for a similar iteration count. From
        the optimization perspective, we find that Top- is the communication-optimal
        sparsifier given a per-iteration  element budget. We argue that to further
        the benefits of gradient sparsification, especially for DNNs, a different
        perspective is necessary—one that moves from per-iteration optimality to consider
        optimality for the entire training. We identify that the total error—the sum
        of the compression errors for all iterations—encapsulates sparsification throughout
        training. Then, we propose a communication complexity model that minimizes
        the total error under a communication budget for the entire training. We find
        that the hard-threshold sparsifier, a variant of the Top- sparsifier with  determined
        by a constant hard-threshold, is the optimal sparsifier for this model. Motivated
        by this, we provide convex and non-convex convergence analyses for the hard-threshold
        sparsifier with error-feedback. We show that hard-threshold has the same asymptotic
        convergence and linear speedup property as SGD in both the case, and unlike
        with Top- sparsifier, has no impact due to data-heterogeneity. Our diverse
        experiments on various DNNs and a logistic regression model demonstrate that
        the hard-threshold sparsifier is more communication-efficient than Top-.

      abstract: Powerful computer clusters are used nowadays to train complex deep
        neural networks (DNN) on large datasets. Distributed training workloads increasingly
        become communication bound. For this reason, many lossy compression techniques
        have been proposed to reduce the volume of transferred data. Unfortunately,
        it is difficult to argue about the behavior of compression methods, because
        existing work relies on inconsistent evaluation testbeds and largely ignores
        the performance impact of practical system configurations.  In this paper,
        we present a comprehensive survey of the most influential compressed communication
        methods for DNN training, together with an intuitive classification (i.e.,
        quantization, sparsification, hybrid and low-rank). We also propose a unified
        framework and API that allows for consistent and easy implementation of compressed

        on TensorFlow and PyTorch, and implement 16 such methods. Finally, we present
        a thorough quantitative evaluation with a variety of DNNs (convolutional and
        recurrent), datasets and system configurations. We show that the DNN architecture
        affects the relative performance among methods. Interestingly, depending on
        the underlying communication library and computational cost of compression/decompression,
        we demonstrate that some methods may be impractical.

      abstract: Powerful computer clusters are used nowadays to train complex deep
        neural networks (DNN) on large datasets. Distributed training increasingly
        becomes communication bound. For this reason, many lossy compression techniques
        have been proposed to reduce the volume of transferred data. Unfortunately,
        it is difficult to argue about the behavior of compression methods, because
        existing work relies on inconsistent evaluation testbeds and largely ignores
        the performance impact of practical system configurations. In this paper,
        we present a comprehensive survey of the most influential compressed communication
        methods for DNN training, together with an intuitive classification (i.e.,
        quantization, sparsification, hybrid and low-rank). Next, we propose GRACE,
        a unified framework and API that allows for consistent and easy implementation
        of compressed communication on popular machine learning toolkits. We …

      abstract: Optimization acceleration techniques such as momentum play a key role
        in state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Recently, generic vector
        sequence extrapolation techniques, such as regularized nonlinear acceleration
        (RNA) of Scieur et al. [22], were proposed and shown to accelerate fixed point
        iterations. In contrast to RNA which computes extrapolation coefficients by
        (approximately) setting the gradient of the objective function to zero at
        the extrapolated point, we propose a more direct approach, which we call direct
        nonlinear acceleration (DNA). In DNA, we aim to minimize (an approximation
        of) the function value at the extrapolated point instead. We adopt a regularized
        approach with regularizers designed to prevent the model from entering a region
        in which the functional approximation is less precise. While the computational

      abstract: 'Sparse tensors appear frequently in federated deep learning, either
        as a direct artifact of the deep neural network’s gradients, or as a result
        of an explicit sparsification process. Existing communication primitives are
        agnostic to the peculiarities of deep learning; consequently, they impose
        unnecessary communication overhead. This paper introduces DeepReduce, a versatile
        framework for the compressed communication of sparse tensors, tailored to
        federated deep learning. DeepReduce decomposes sparse tensors into two sets,
        values and indices, and allows both independent and combined compression of
        these sets. We support a variety of common compressors, such as Deflate for
        values, or run-length encoding for indices. We also propose two novel compression
        schemes that achieve superior results: curve fitting-based for values, and
        bloom filter-based for indices. DeepReduce is orthogonal to existing gradient
        sparsifiers and can be applied in conjunction with them, transparently to
        the end-user, to significantly lower the communication overhead. As proof
        of concept, we implement our approach on TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our experiments
        with large real models demonstrate that DeepReduce transmits 320% less data
        than existing sparsifiers, without affecting accuracy. Code is available at

        values people hold. Prior work has explored social and potentially harmful
        biases encoded in Pre-Trained Language models (PTLMs). However, there has
        been no systematic study investigating how values embedded in these models
        vary across cultures. In this paper, we introduce probes to study which values
        across cultures are embedded in these models, and whether they align with
        existing theories and cross-cultural value surveys. We find that PTLMs capture
        differences in values across cultures, but those only weakly align with established
        value surveys. We discuss implications of using mis-aligned models in cross-cultural
        settings, as well as ways of aligning PTLMs with value surveys.

      abstract: 'The goal of stance detection is to determine the viewpoint expressed
        in a piece of text towards a target. These viewpoints or contexts are often
        expressed in many different languages depending on the user and the platform,
        which can be a local news outlet, a social media platform, a news forum, etc.
        Most research on stance detection, however, has been limited to working with
        a single language and on a few limited targets, with little work on cross-lingual
        stance detection. Moreover, non-English sources of labelled data are often
        scarce and present additional challenges. Recently, large multilingual language
        models have substantially improved the performance on many non-English tasks,
        especially such with a limited number of examples. This highlights the importance
        of model pre-training and its ability to learn from few examples. In this
        paper, we present the most comprehensive study of cross-lingual stance detection
        to date: we experiment with 15 diverse datasets in 12 languages from 6 language
        families, and with 6 low-resource evaluation settings each. For our experiments,
        we build on pattern-exploiting training (PET), proposing the addition of a
        novel label encoder to simplify the verbalisation procedure. We further propose
        sentiment-based generation of stance data for pre-training, which shows sizeable
        improvement of more than 6% F1 absolute in few-shot learning settings compared
        to several strong baselines.'

      abstract: Stance Detection is concerned with identifying the attitudes expressed
        by an author towards a target of interest. This task spans a variety of domains
        ranging from social media opinion identification to detecting the stance for
        a legal claim. However, the framing of the task varies within these domains,
        in terms of the data collection protocol, the label dictionary and the number
        of available annotations. Furthermore, these stance annotations are significantly
        imbalanced on a per-topic and inter-topic basis. These make multi-domain stance
        detection a challenging task, requiring standardization and domain adaptation.
        To overcome this challenge, we propose opic fficient anc etection (TESTED),
        consisting of a topic-guided diversity sampling technique and a contrastive
        objective that is used for fine-tuning a stance classifier. We evaluate the
        method on an existing benchmark of  datasets with in-domain, i.e. all topics
        seen and out-of-domain, i.e. unseen topics, experiments. The results show
        that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with an average of  F1 points
        increase in-domain, and is more generalizable with an averaged increase of  F1
        on out-of-domain evaluation while using  of the training data. We show that
        our sampling technique mitigates both inter- and per-topic class imbalances.
        Finally, our analysis demonstrates that the contrastive learning objective
        allows the model a more pronounced segmentation of samples with varying labels.

      abstract: Dual use, the intentional, harmful reuse of technology and scientific
        artefacts, is a problem yet to be well-defined within the context of Natural
        Language Processing (NLP). However, as NLP technologies continue to advance
        and become increasingly widespread in society, their inner workings have become
        increasingly opaque. Therefore, understanding dual use concerns and potential
        ways of limiting them is critical to minimising the potential harms of research
        and development. In this paper, we conduct a survey of NLP researchers and
        practitioners to understand the depth and their perspective of the problem
        as well as to assess existing available support. Based on the results of our
        survey, we offer a definition of dual use that is tailored to the needs of
        the NLP community. The survey revealed that a majority of researchers are
        concerned about the potential dual use of their research but only take limited
        action toward it. In light of the survey results, we discuss the current state
        and potential means for mitigating dual use in NLP and propose a checklist
        that can be integrated into existing conference ethics-frameworks, e.g., the
        ACL ethics checklist.

        (a) as a component of fact-checking, rumour detection, and detecting previously
        fact-checked claims, or (b) as a task in its own right. While there have been

        argumentation mining and sentiment analysis, there is no existing survey on
        examining the relationship between stance detection and mis- and disinformation
        detection. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by reviewing and analysing existing
        work in this area, with mis- and disinformation in focus, and discussing lessons
        learnt and future challenges.

        is fact checking, where a set of connected evidence pieces leads to the final
        verdict of a claim. However, existing datasets either do not provide annotations
        for gold evidence pages, or the only dataset which does (FEVER) mostly consists
        of claims which can be fact-checked with simple reasoning and is constructed
        artificially. Here, we study more complex claim verification of naturally
        occurring claims with multiple hops over interconnected evidence chunks. We:
        1) construct a small annotated dataset, PolitiHop, of evidence sentences for
        claim verification; 2) compare it to existing multi-hop datasets; and 3) study
        how to transfer knowledge from more extensive in- and out-of-domain resources

      abstract: Stance detection concerns the classification of a writer's viewpoint
        towards a target. There are different task variants, e.g., stance of a tweet
        vs. a full article, or stance with respect to a claim vs. an (implicit) topic.
        Moreover, task definitions vary, which includes the label inventory, the data
        collection, and the annotation protocol. All these aspects hinder cross-domain
        studies, as they require changes to standard domain adaptation approaches.
        In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of 16 stance detection datasets,
        and we explore the possibility for cross-domain learning from them. Moreover,
        we propose an end-to-end unsupervised framework for out-of-domain prediction
        of unseen, user-defined labels. In particular, we combine domain adaptation
        techniques such as mixture of experts and domain-adversarial training with
        label embeddings, and we demonstrate sizable performance gains over strong
        baselines, both (i) in-domain, i.e., for seen targets, and (ii) out-of-domain,
        i.e., for unseen targets. Finally, we perform an exhaustive analysis of the

      abstract: The importance of neighborhood construction in local explanation methods
        has been already highlighted in the literature. And several attempts have
        been made to improve neighborhood quality for high-dimensional data, for example,
        texts, by adopting generative models. Although the generators produce more
        realistic samples, the intuitive sampling approaches in the existing solutions
        leave the latent space underexplored. To overcome this problem, our work,
        focusing on local model-agnostic explanations for text classifiers, proposes
        a progressive approximation approach that refines the neighborhood of a to-be-explained
        decision with a careful two-stage interpolation using counterfactuals as landmarks.
        We explicitly specify the two properties that should be satisfied by generative
        models, the reconstruction ability and the locality-preserving property, to
        guide the selection of generators for local explanation methods. Moreover,
        noticing the opacity of generative models during the study, we propose another
        method that implements progressive neighborhood approximation with probability-based
        editions as an alternative to the generator-based solution. The explanation
        results from both methods consist of word-level and instance-level explanations

      abstract: Detecting outliers in a large set of data objects is a major data
        mining task aiming at finding different mechanisms responsible for different
        groups of objects in a data set. All existing approaches, however, are based
        on an assessment of distances (sometimes indirectly by assuming certain distributions)
        in the full-dimensional Euclidean data space. In high-dimensional data, these
        approaches are bound to deteriorate due to the notorious "curse of dimensionality".
        In this paper, we propose a novel approach named ABOD (Angle-Based Outlier
        Detection) and some variants assessing the variance in the angles between
        the difference vectors of a point to the other points. This way, the effects
        of the "curse of dimensionality" are alleviated compared to purely distance-based
        approaches. A main advantage of our new approach is that our method does not
        rely on any parameter selection influencing the quality of the …

      abstract: The evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is a constant
        challenge in data mining research. Little is known regarding the strengths
        and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact
        of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark
        datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation
        of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability
        for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases
        of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus
        difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection
        methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive

      abstract: Over the last years, more and more sport related data are being collected,
        stored, and analyzed to give valuable insights. Football is no exception to
        this trend. An important way of identifying a team’s “style” of play is through
        analyzing passing sequences. However, passing sequences either concentrate
        on the specific players involved or the structure of passes and ignore where
        these sequences took place. In this paper, we focus on identifying frequent
        passing zone subsequences that lead to created or conceded goal scoring opportunities.
        We partition the pitch into a set of disjoint zones and apply sequential pattern
        mining. Our experimental study on the 2020/21 Danish Superliga season shows
        that our method is able to predict goal scoring opportunities better than
        random subsequences that occurred, in median, 99.5% of the cases.

      abstract: High‐dimensional data in Euclidean space pose special challenges to
        data mining algorithms. These challenges are often indiscriminately subsumed
        under the term ‘curse of dimensionality’, more concrete aspects being the
        so‐called ‘distance concentration effect’, the presence of irrelevant attributes
        concealing relevant information, or simply efficiency issues. In about just
        the last few years, the task of unsupervised outlier detection has found new
        specialized solutions for tackling high‐dimensional data in Euclidean space.
        These approaches fall under mainly two categories, namely considering or not
        considering subspaces (subsets of attributes) for the definition of outliers.
        The former are specifically addressing the presence of irrelevant attributes,
        the latter do consider the presence of irrelevant attributes implicitly at
        best but are more concerned with general issues of efficiency and effectiveness.

      abstract: Body ownership illusions (BOIs) occur when participants experience

        Based on a systematic review of the cumulative evidence on BOIs from 111 research

      abstract: The relation between the body and computer interfaces has undergone
        several shifts since the advent of computing. In early models of interaction,
        the body was treated as a periphery to the mind, much like a keyboard is peripheral
        to a computer. The goal of the interface designers was to optimize the information
        flow between the brain and the computer, using these imperfect peripheral
        devices. Toward the end of the previous century the social body, as well as
        the material body and its physical manipulation skills started receiving increased
        consideration from interaction designers. The goal of the interface designer
        shifted, requiring the designer to understand the role of the body in a given
        context, and adapting the interface to respect the social context and to make
        use of the tacit knowledge that the body has of how the physical world functions.

      abstract: Virtual reality can help realize mediated social experiences where
        distance disappears and we interact as richly with those around the world
        as we do with those in the same room. The design of social virtual experiences
        presents a challenge for remotely located users with room-scale setups like
        those afforded by recent commodity virtual reality devices. Since users inhabit
        different physical spaces that may not be the same size, a mapping to a shared
        virtual space is needed for creating experiences that allow everyone to use
        real walking for locomotion. We designed three mapping techniques that enable
        users from diverse room-scale setups to interact together in virtual reality.
        Results from our user study (N = 26) show that our mapping techniques positively
        influence the perceived degree of togetherness and copresence while the size
        of each user's tracked space influences individual presence.

      abstract: Recently, various intermediate layer distillation (ILD) objectives
        have been shown to improve compression of BERT models via Knowledge Distillation
        (KD). However, a comprehensive evaluation of the objectives in both task-specific
        and task-agnostic settings is lacking. To the best of our knowledge, this
        is the first work comprehensively evaluating distillation objectives in both
        settings. We show that attention transfer gives the best performance overall.
        We also study the impact of layer choice when initializing the student from
        the teacher layers, finding a significant impact on the performance in task-specific
        distillation. For vanilla KD and hidden states transfer, initialisation with
        lower layers of the teacher gives a considerable improvement over higher layers,
        especially on the task of QNLI (up to an absolute percentage change of 17.8
        in accuracy). Attention transfer behaves consistently under different initialisation
        settings. We release our code as an efficient transformer-based model distillation
        framework for further studies.

      abstract: Psychology research suggests that certain personality traits correlate
        with linguistic behavior. This correlation can be effectively modeled with
        statistical natural language processing techniques. Prediction accuracy generally
        improves with larger data samples, which also allows for more lexical features.
        Most existing work on personality prediction, however, focuses on small samples
        and closed-vocabulary investigations. Both factors limit the generality and
        statistical power of the results. In this paper, we explore the use of social
        media as a resource for large-scale, openvocabulary personality detection.
        We analyze which features are predictive of which personality traits, and

      abstract: Automatic description generation from natural images is a challenging
        problem that has recently received a large amount of interest from the computer
        vision and natural language processing communities. In this survey, we classify
        the existing approaches based on how they conceptualize this problem, viz.,
        models that cast description as either generation problem or as a retrieval
        problem over a visual or multimodal representational space. We provide a detailed
        review of existing models, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.
        Moreover, we give an overview of the benchmark image datasets and the evaluation
        measures that have been developed to assess the quality of machine-generated
        image descriptions. Finally we extrapolate future directions in the area of
        automatic image description generation.

      abstract: 'Instruction-tuning has become an integral part of training pipelines
        for Large Language Models (LLMs) and has been shown to yield strong performance
        gains. In an orthogonal line of research, Annotation Error Detection (AED)
        has emerged as a tool for detecting quality issues of gold-standard labels.
        But so far, the application of AED methods is limited to discriminative settings.
        It is an open question how well AED methods generalize to generative settings
        which are becoming widespread via generative LLMs. In this work, we present
        a first and new benchmark for AED on instruction-tuning data: Donkii. It encompasses
        three instruction-tuning datasets enriched with annotations by experts and
        semi-automatic methods. We find that all three datasets contain clear-cut
        errors that sometimes directly propagate into instruction-tuned LLMs. We propose
        four AED baselines for the generative setting and evaluate them comprehensively
        on the newly introduced dataset. Our results demonstrate that choosing the
        right AED method and model size is indeed crucial, thereby deriving practical
        recommendations. To gain insights, we provide a first case-study to examine
        how the quality of the instruction-tuning datasets influences downstream performance.'

      abstract: Bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks have recently
        proven successful for various NLP sequence modeling tasks, but little is known
        about their reliance to input representations, target languages, data set
        size, and label noise. We address these issues and evaluate bi-LSTMs with
        word, character, and unicode byte embeddings for POS tagging. We compare bi-LSTMs
        to traditional POS taggers across languages and data sizes. We also present
        a novel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with an
        auxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The model obtains state-of-the-art
        performance across 22 languages, and works especially well for morphologically
        complex languages. Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are less sensitive
        to training data size and label corruptions (at small noise levels) than previously
        assumed.

      abstract: Manually annotated datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
        Natural Language Processing models. However, recent work has discovered that
        even widely-used benchmark datasets contain a substantial number of erroneous
        annotations. This problem has been addressed with Annotation Error Detection
        (AED) models, which can flag such errors for human re-annotation. However,
        even though many of these AED methods assume a final curation step in which
        a human annotator decides whether the annotation is erroneous, they have been
        developed as static models without any human-in-the-loop component. In this
        work, we propose ActiveAED, an AED method that can detect errors more accurately
        by repeatedly querying a human for error corrections in its prediction loop.
        We evaluate ActiveAED on eight datasets spanning five different tasks and
        find that it leads to improvements over the state of the art on seven of them,
        with gains of up to six percentage points in average precision.

      abstract: Recent advances of powerful Language Models have allowed Natural Language
        Generation (NLG) to emerge as an important technology that can not only perform
        traditional tasks like summarisation or translation, but also serve as a natural
        language interface to a variety of applications. As such, it is crucial that
        NLG systems are trustworthy and reliable, for example by indicating when they
        are likely to be wrong; and supporting multiple views, backgrounds and writing
        styles -- reflecting diverse human sub-populations. In this paper, we argue
        that a principled treatment of uncertainty can assist in creating systems
        and evaluation protocols better aligned with these goals. We first present
        the fundamental theory, frameworks and vocabulary required to represent uncertainty.
        We then characterise the main sources of uncertainty in NLG from a linguistic
        perspective, and propose a two-dimensional taxonomy that is more informative
        and faithful than the popular aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy. Finally, we move
        from theory to applications and highlight exciting research directions that
        exploit uncertainty to power decoding, controllable generation, self-assessment,
        selective answering, active learning and more.

      abstract: We have made the largest volume measurement to date of the transition
        to large-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. We use the WiggleZ
        survey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200 000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volume
        of ∼1 h−3 Gpc3. A new method of defining the ‘homogeneity scale' is presented,
        which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and which
        can be easily compared between different surveys. Due to the large cosmic
        depth of WiggleZ (up to z = 1), we are able to make the first measurement
        of the transition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. The mean number
        of galaxies N(< r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r3 within
        1 per cent, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within
        1 per cent of D2 = 3, at radii larger than 71 ± 8 h−1Mpc at z ∼ 0.2, 70 ±

        in the Milky Way. This result relied on a sample containing 79 hard X-ray-selected
        HMXBs and 458 OB associations. Clustering between the two populations is detected
        with a significance above 7σ for distances< 1 kpc. Thus, HMXBs closely trace
        the underlying distribution of the massive star-forming regions that are expected
        to produce the progenitor stars of HMXBs. The average offset of 0.4±0.2 kpc
        between HMXBs and OB associations is consistent with being due to natal kicks
        at velocities of the order of 100±50 km s− 1. The characteristic scale of
        the correlation function suggests an average kinematical age (since the supernova

      abstract: 'High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are systems in which a compact object
        (usually a neutron star) accretes from a massive stellar companion (M≳ 10M⊙).
        The mass-age relation in stellar evolution predicts that∼ 107 yr elapses between
        starbirth and supernova in high-mass stars [1]. Thus, HMXBs are relatively
        young systems which are not expected to migrate far from their birthplaces:
        sites with a recent history of massive star formation, ie, the OB associations
        (OBAs) that trace the Galactic spiral arms [2]. A precise study of the spatial
        relation of massive star-forming regions and the HMXBs they spawn can offer
        valuable insight into stellar and Galactic evolution. Observational evidence
        linking Galactic HMXBs and OBAs has been demonstrated in individual cases
        in which the connection is attested by other factors: ie, consistent proper
        motions and distances [3]. While INTEGRAL has been instrumental in helping
        to increase the known population of HMXBs, the evidence on a Galactic scale
        is limited to comparing distributions of longitudes or galactocentric distances
        [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The drawback is that a single spatial dimension is considered
        at a time, and so precious information about the true proximity of objects
        in the populations is lost. A better approach is to construct the spatial
        (or cross-) correlation function ξ [9, 10]. Our sample includes all INTEGRAL-ISGRI
        detected sources that are confirmed or strongly suspected of being HMXBs.
        For each HMXB, we searched through the literature and extracted the most recent

      abstract: Despite the great promise of machine-learning algorithms to classify
        and predict astrophysical parameters for the vast numbers of astrophysical
        sources and transients observed in large-scale surveys, the peculiarities
        of the training data often manifest as strongly biased predictions on the
        data of interest. Typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys
        of brighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive, deeper surveys
        (testing data). This sample selection bias can cause catastrophic errors in
        predictions on the testing data because (1) standard assumptions for machine-learned
        model selection procedures break down and (2) dense regions of testing space
        might be completely devoid of training data. We explore possible remedies
        to sample selection bias, including importance weighting, co-training, and

      abstract: Over the past decade scholarly consensus has moved away from viewing
        turmoil in Turkey as a product of religious–cultural incompatibility with
        modernization. Instead, scholars have shown that the rise of an Islamic elite
        has expanded democracy in Turkey, while often vexing the secularist elite.
        This article reviews the most important of the new scholarship, but criticizes
        it for inheriting the assumption that all events in Turkey somehow hinge upon
        Islamist–secularist antagonism. Alternatively, insights from sociology are
        employed to argue that domestic Turkish discord is intimately related to industrialization
        and democratization, and that excessive attention to supposedly religious
        conflict blinds much contemporary scholarship to the intolerant Sunni-Turkish
        nationalism cultivated by the Turkish state.

      abstract: This article examines the disease motif in Lu Xun’s “Diary of a Madman”(1918)
        and in Ding Ling’s “Miss Sophia’s Diary”(1928) in their historical and medical
        contexts. At its most fundamental, the contemporaneous Chinese conception
        of health was thermodynamic, vesting the utmost importance in the circulation
        of energies and substances. This conception had immense social importance
        because it provided part of the ideological scaffolding for the family structure.
        Inside the family, established responsibilities and hierarchies purportedly
        served to guide this circulation in ways supportive of health, and the same
        considerations charged family members with maintaining strict scrutiny of
        the family’s barriers against any potentially illness-inducing influences
        that might penetrate the family fortress. Written at a time when political,
        social, and scientific verities were crumbling in China, these diaries record
        the foibles and concerns of two diseased individuals who stand alienated from
        their families and their immediate surroundings. By focusing on this alienation,
        as well as on the shared interests of the diarists in boundary crossing flows
        and anthropophagy, this article suggests that these short stories can profitably
        be read as explorations of the anxieties facing this generation of young Chinese
        as they sought to make a world for themselves independently of their families.
        What these stories dramatize is that leaving the family behind might have
        medical ramifications in addition to social and financial costs. In the current
        covid-19 context, we may not need reminding that ideas about disease and health
        relate in important ways to how we think of the …

      abstract: 'This article examines how China’s Communist Party (CCP) sought to
        justify its policies fostering inequality at the urban factory floor in the
        early years after Mao’s death through publications in the People’s Daily.
        The article focuses on three issues that emerged frequently in the newspaper:
        the increased prevalence of incentive wages, the abolishment of life-time
        employment for workers and the evolving discourse related to worker influence
        at their workplace. The article shows that the People’s Daily did not simply
        seek to persuade the public that the reforms were compatible with socialism,
        the newspaper also took great care to showcase which kinds of behaviours and
        emotions would be appropriate for the new working subject. The CCP’s dedication
        to reforming the population through the press makes the People’s Daily an
        excellent source for tracking norm intransigence on the part of the population.
        Based on the observation that the CCP sought to legitimate policies ending
        employment security many years before such policies were adopted, the article
        also suggests that public opinion had a direct influence on the timing of
        the early reforms.'

      abstract: This article critically interrogates media coverage of Claus Meyer,
        Danish gastro-entrepreneur, founder of New Nordic Cuisine, and co-founder
        of the restaurant noma. The article analyzes how the Danish press has constructed
        Meyer as an exemplary social entrepreneur on a mission to take on established
        agro-industrial interests and change the ways we produce and consume food.
        We argue that uncritical media narratives, that positioned Claus Meyer as
        the little man who successfully took on the establishment, in fact helped
        to produce brand value for his company in part by glossing over his close
        ties to state and corporate interests as well as Meyer’s quite conventional
        business practices. The media’s portrayal of Meyer as an entrepreneur on a
        social mission constitutes an uncritical celebration of the social entrepreneur
        and the marketization of society.

      abstract: The past century's rewriting of Chinese history is surely among the
        most exciting developments of our time. Astonishing discoveries of unknown
        texts and artifacts have destroyed some myths while confirming others, and
        have provided the impetus for much effort in sociology, anthropology, and
        linguistics. Sub-disciplines of history, such as the histories of mathematics,
        medicine, and architecture, have been much enriched by new finds as well as
        by translations of earlier Chinese works. Indeed, in books of modern world
        history China has made the remarkable transition from lackluster sideshow
        to central venue within a few decades. At the same time, as Paul Cohen pointed
        out twenty-five years ago, the flurry of novel thoughts and methods within
        the historic field has made it legitimate for historians writing about modern
        China to focus their attention on many previously

      abstract: One of the widely acknowledged consequences of the economic reforms
        in China over the past four decades has been widened social-gender gap and
        hence increased gender inequalities. In recent years, there is a rising concern
        of inequality in China and a mounting intellectual reflection and critique
        of the growth-focused development path China has followed so far. This collection
        can be seen as a part of this critique, but the focus is on gender and various
        forms of inequality pertaining to gender and gender relations. The book shows
        how various gender inequality issues are approached and analysed in the location
        of China by Chinese gender/social science scholars and how studies of gender
        inequality constitutes an astute critique of the neo-liberal capitalist development
        in China. The book brings forth a distinctive gender perspective to the Chinese
        intellectual and political analysis of social inequality and a …

      abstract: A framework for composition synthesis is provided in which metalanguage
        combinators are supported and the execution of synthesized programs can be
        staged into composition-time code generation (stage 1) and run-time execution
        (stage 2). By extending composition synthesis to encompass both object language
        (L1) and metalanguage (L2) combinators, composition synthesis becomes a powerful
        and flexible framework for the generation of L1-program compositions. A system
        of modal intersection types is introduced into a combinatory composition language
        to control the distinction between L1- and L2-combinators at the type level,
        thereby exposing the language distinction to composition synthesis. We provide
        a theory of correctness of the framework which ensures that generated compositions
        of component implementations are well typed and that their execution can be
        staged such that all …

      abstract: Managing and verifying forest products in a value chain is often reliant
        on easily manipulated document or digital tracking methods–Chain of Custody
        Systems. We aim to create a new means of tracking timber by developing a tamper
        proof digital system based on Blockchain technology. Blockchain will be combined
        with new digital protocols for physical verification and authentication. Deliverables
        include online traceability system, and procedures for entering and verifying
        data inputs. Certification schemes and governments gain increased legitimacy
        from tamper-proof means to comply with timber trade requirements. Global companies
        gain from efficient traceability; society at large benefits from increased
        tax revenues, anti-corruption, and environmental benefits from sustainable
        forestry. We think this potential collaboration between government and industry
        can help simplify a variety of current due diligence processes, in this paper
        we focus on timber tracking.

      abstract: Smart contracts executed on blockchains are interactive programs where
        external actors generate events that trigger function invocations. Events
        can be emitted by participants asynchronously. However, some functionalities
        should be restricted to participants inhabiting specific roles in the system,
        which might be dynamically adjusted while the system evolves. We argue that
        current smart contract languages adopting imperative programming paradigms
        require additional complicated access control code. Furthermore, smart contracts
        are often developed independently and cannot share a joint access control
        policy. We propose to use Dynamic Condition Response Graphs for role-based
        and declarative access control for smart contracts. We show that they allow
        to capture and visualize a form of dynamic access control where access rights
        evolve as the contract state progresses. Their use supports straight-forward

      abstract: Blockchain sharding splits a blockchain into several shards where
        consensus is reached at the shard level rather than over the entire blockchain.
        It improves transaction throughput and reduces the computational resources
        required of individual nodes. But a derivation of trustworthy consensus within
        a shard becomes an issue as the longest chain based mechanisms used in conventional
        blockchains can no longer be used. Instead, a vote-based consensus mechanism
        must be employed. However, existing vote-based Byzantine fault tolerance consensus
        protocols do not offer sufficient security guarantees for sharded blockchains.
        First, when used to support consensus where only one block is allowed at a
        time (binary consensus), these protocols are susceptible to progress-hindering
        attacks (i.e., unable to reach a consensus). Second, when used to support
        a stronger type of consensus where multiple concurrent …

        of conventional centralized outsourcing, the architecture of secure keyword

        be applied to a variety of domains where AI systems are used, such as business,

      abstract: Building artificial intelligence (AI) systems that adhere to ethical
        standards is a complex problem. Even though a multitude of guidelines for
        the design and development of such trustworthy AI systems exist, these guidelines
        focus on high-level and abstract requirements for AI systems, and it is often
        very difficult to assess if a specific system fulfills these requirements.
        The Z-Inspection® process provides a holistic and dynamic framework to evaluate
        the trustworthiness of specific AI systems at different stages of the AI lifecycle,
        including intended use, design, and development. It focuses, in particular,

      abstract: Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has emerged as an increasingly popular
        sensing paradigm due to its cost-effectiveness. This approach relies on platforms
        to outsource tasks to participating workers when prompted by task publishers.
        Although incentive mechanisms have been devised to foster widespread participation
        in MCS, most of them focus only on static tasks (i.e., tasks for which the
        timing and type are known in advance) and do not protect the privacy of worker
        bids. In a dynamic and resource-constrained environment, tasks are often uncertain
        (i.e., the platform lacks a priori knowledge about the tasks) and worker bids
        may be vulnerable to inference attacks. This paper presents HERALD*, an incentive
        mechanism that addresses these issues through the use of uncertainty and hidden
        bids. Theoretical analysis reveals that HERALD* satisfies a range of critical
        criteria, including truthfulness, individual rationality, differential privacy,
        low computational complexity, and low social cost. These properties are then
        corroborated through a series of evaluations.

      abstract: 'In combinatory logic one usually assumes a fixed set of basic combinators
        (axiom schemes), usually K and S. In this setting the set of provable formulas
        (inhabited types) is PSPACE-complete in simple types and undecidable in intersection
        types. When arbitrary sets of axiom schemes are considered, the inhabitation
        problem is undecidable even in simple types (this is known as Linial-Post
        theorem). k-bounded combinatory logic with intersection types arises from
        combinatory logic by imposing the bound k on the depth of types (formulae)
        which may be substituted for type variables in axiom schemes. We consider
        the inhabitation (provability) problem for k-bounded combinatory logic: Given
        an arbitrary set of typed combinators and a type tau, is there a combinatory
        term of type tau in k-bounded combinatory logic? Our main result is that the
        problem is (k+ 2)-EXPTIME complete for k-bounded combinatory logic with intersection
        types, for every fixed k (and hence non-elementary when k is a parameter).
        We also show that the problem is EXPTIME-complete for simple types, for all
        k. Theoretically, our results give new insight into the expressive power of
        intersection types. From an application perspective, our results are useful
        as a foundation for composition synthesis based on combinatory logic.'

        framework for objective evaluation of automatic dental radiography analysis
        algorithms has been established under the auspices of the IEEE International
        Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2015 Bitewing Radiography Caries Detection
        Challenge and Cephalometric X-ray Image Analysis Challenge. In this article,
        we present the datasets, methods and results of the challenge and lay down
        the principles for future uses of this benchmark. The main contributions of
        the challenge include the creation of the dental anatomy data repository of
        bitewing radiographs, the creation of the anatomical abnormality classification

      abstract: 'This paper describes our solution for the Dental Enumeration and
        Diagnosis on Panoramic X-rays Challenge at MICCAI 2023. Our approach consists
        of a multi-step framework tailored to the task of detecting and classifying
        abnormal teeth. The solution includes three sequential stages: dental instance
        detection, healthy instance filtering, and abnormal instance classification.
        In the first stage, we employed a Faster-RCNN model for detecting and identifying
        teeth. In subsequent stages, we designed a model that merged the encoding
        pathway of a pretrained U-net, optimized for dental lesion detection, with
        the Vgg16 architecture. The resulting model was first used for filtering out
        healthy teeth. Then, any identified abnormal teeth were categorized, potentially
        falling into one or more of the following conditions: embeddded, periapical
        lesion, caries, deep caries. The model performing dental instance detection
        achieved an AP score of 0.49. The model responsible for identifying healthy
        teeth attained an F1 score of 0.71. Meanwhile, the model trained for multi-label
        dental disease classification achieved an F1 score of 0.76. The code is available

        kidney is a crucial step as the position of the percutaneous tract can affect

      abstract: Higher-order abstract syntax is a central representation technique
        in many logical frameworks, that is, meta-langnages designed for the formalization
        of deductive systems. The basic idea is to represent variables of the object
        language by variables in the meta-langnage. Consequently, object language
        constructs which bind variables must be represented by meta-langnage constructs
        which bind the corresponding variables.This deceptively simple idea, which
        goes back to Church [1] and Martin-LSf's system of arities [18], has far-reaching
        consequences for the methodology of logical frameworks. On one hand, encodings
        of logical systems using this idea are often extremely concise and elegant,

        capture-avoiding substitution, or parametric and hypothetical judgments are

      abstract: Higher-order abstract syntax is a central representation technique
        in logical frameworks which maps variables of the object language into variables
        of the meta-language. It leads to concise encodings, but is incompatible with
        functions defined by primitive recursion or proofs by induction. In this paper
        we propose an extension of the simply typed lambda-calculus with iteration
        and case constructs which preserves the adequacy of higher-order abstract
        syntax encodings. The well-known paradoxes are avoided through the use of
        a modal operator which obeys the laws of S 4. In the resulting calculus many
        functions over higher-order representations can be expressed elegantly. Our
        central technical result, namely that our calculus is conservative over the

        logical relations. We view our system as an important first step towards allowing

      abstract: Session types are types for specifying the protocols that communicating
        processes must follow in a concurrent system. When composing two or more well-typed
        processes, a session typing system must check whether such processes are multiparty
        compatible, a property that guarantees that all sent messages are eventually
        received and no deadlock ever occurs. Previous work has shown that duality
        and the more general notion of coherence are sufficient syntactic conditions
        for guaranteeing the multiparty compatibility property. In this paper, following
        a propositions-as-types fashion which relates session types to linear logic,
        we generalise coherence to forwarders. Forwarders are processes that act as
        middleware by forwarding messages according to a given protocol. Our main
        result shows that forwarders not only generalise coherence, but fully capture
        all well-typed multiparty compatible processes.

        privacy and efficient tallying. Receiptfreeness relies on deniable vote updating
        and verifiable null ballot posting, generated from public knowledge stored
        on the bulletin board. The everlasting vote and participation privacy properties
        directly result from the hash-based commitment scheme and efficient zero-knowledge

      abstract: In this paper, we propose Advanced Tree-algorithm with Interference
        Cancellation (ATIC), a variant of binary tree-algorithm with successive interference
        cancellation (SICTA) introduced by Yu and Giannakis. ATIC assumes that Interference
        Cancellation (IC) can be performed both by the access point (AP), as in SICTA,
        but also by the users. Specifically, after every collision slot, the AP broadcasts
        the observed collision as feedback. Users who participated in the collision
        then attempt to perform IC by subtracting their transmissions from the collision
        signal. This way, the users can resolve collisions of degree 2 and, using
        a simple distributed arbitration algorithm based on user IDs, ensure that
        the next slot will contain just a single transmission. We show that ATIC reaches
        the asymptotic throughput of 0.924 as the number of initially collided users
        tends to infinity and reduces the number of collisions and packet delay. We
        also compare ATIC with other tree algorithms and indicate the extra feedback
        resources it requires.

      abstract: The fifth generation of cellular communication systems is foreseen
        to enable a multitude of new applications and use cases with very different
        requirements. A new 5G multi-service air interface needs to enhance broadband
        performance as well as provide new levels of reliability, latency, and supported
        number of users. In this paper, we focus on the massive Machine Type Communications
        (mMTC) service within a multi-service air interface. Specifically, we present
        an overview of different physical and medium access techniques to address
        the problem of a massive number of access attempts in mMTC and discuss the
        protocol performance of these solutions in a common evaluation framework.

      abstract: URLLC is an important new feature brought by 5G, with a potential
        to support a vast set of applications that rely on mission-critical links.
        In this article, we first discuss the principles for supporting URLLC from
        the perspective of the traditional assumptions and models applied in communication/information
        theory. We then discuss how these principles are applied in various elements
        of system design, such as use of various diversity sources, design of packets,
        and access protocols. The important message is that there is a need to optimize
        the transmission of signaling information, as well as a need for lean use
        of various sources of diversity.

      abstract: In this paper, we analyze the throughput and reliability of an indoor
        optical wireless communication (OWC)-based Internet of Things (IoT) system
        based on Slotted ALOHA (SA) where IoT devices exchange data with an access
        point (AP). Assuming that the OWC receiver at the AP exploits the capture
        effect, we derive the error probability of decoding a short-length data packet
        that originates from a randomly selected OWC IoT device in the presence of
        interfering users. The analysis is based on the derivation of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
        (SINR) statistics and the application of the finite block-length (FBL) information
        theory. Using these analytical results, we derive relevant performance parameters
        such as the system throughput and reliability expressed in terms of the outage
        probability of a user transmission. The main trade-offs between the system
        performance and the OWC system setup parameters …

      abstract: Age of Information (AoI) and delay are crucial performance metrics
        for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications not only to perform
        seamless actuation and control actions but also to enable self-organized and
        re-configurable manufacturing systems. A challenging task in heterogeneous
        IIoT networks is to minimize the AoI while maintaining a predefined delay
        constraint. In this work, we consider a Device-to-Device (D2D)-based heterogeneous
        IIoT network that supports two types of traffic flows, namely AoI-sensitive
        flow and delay-sensitive flow. First, we introduce a distributed backlog-aware
        random access protocol that allows the AoI-sensitive nodes to opportunistically
        access the channel based on the queue occupancy of the delay-sensitive node.
        Then, we develop an analytical framework to evaluate the average delay and
        the average AoI, and formulate an optimization problem to minimize the AoI

      abstract: Currently, there is a plethora of low-power wide-area IoT networking
        solutions available, each targeting a specific niche of use-cases and deployment
        scenarios. Existing studies on reliability evaluations of IoT solutions rely
        on the assumption that a single technology is deployed in the service area,
        or different IoT technologies operate over dedicated spectrum bands. Here,
        we investigate the reliability performance of IoT communications in coexisting

        resources. Our focus is on solutions exploiting grant-free communications,

      abstract: The next wave of wireless technologies will proliferate in connecting
        sensors, machines, and robots for myriad new applications, thereby creating
        the fabric for the Internet of Things (IoT). A generic scenario for IoT connectivity
        involves a massive number of machine-type connections, but in a typical application,
        only a small (unknown) subset of devices are active at any given instant;
        therefore, one of the key challenges of providing massive IoT connectivity
        is to detect the active devices first and then decode their data with low
        latency. This article advocates the usage of grant-free, rather than grantbased
        random access schemes to overcome the challenge of massive IoT access. Several
        key signal processing techniques that promote the performance of the grant-free

      abstract: Smart factory of the future is expected to support interoperability
        on the shop floor, where information systems are pivotal in enabling interconnectivity
        between its physical assets. In this era of digital transformation, manufacturing
        execution system (MES) is emerging as a critical software tool to support
        production planning and control while accessing the shop floor data. However,
        application of MES as an enterprise information system still lacks the decision
        support capabilities on the shop floor. As an attempt to design intelligent
        MES, this paper demonstrates one of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications
        in the manufacturing domain by presenting a decision support mechanism for
        MES aimed at production coordination. Machine learning (ML) was used to develop
        an anomaly detection algorithm for multi-agent based MES to facilitate autonomous
        production execution and process optimization (in this paper switching the
        machine off after anomaly detection on the production line). Thus, MES executes
        the ‘turning off’of the machine without human intervention. The contribution
        of the paper includes a concept of next-generation MES that has embedded AI,
        ie, a MES system architecture combined with machine learning (ML) technique
        for multi-agent MES. Future research directions are also put forward in this
        position paper.

      abstract: Web service security is essential for SOA-based applications. Based
        on the analysis of the two existing authentications of REST-style Web services,
        Basic HTTP Authentication and HTTP Digest Authentication, we propose an extended
        UsernameToken-based approach for REST-style Web service. In this approach,
        the WS-Security UsernameToken and secondary password are added into the HTTP
        header. By this way, the approach allows service providers to define their
        own authentication which makes up for the disadvantages of the current security
        aspect of REST-style Web services, especially when Basic HTTP Authentication
        and HTTP Digest Authentication are not applicable. Analysis shows that the
        approach implements the REST-style Web service security effectively.

        multiple aspects of the mind: perception, memory, problem solving, and consciousness.
        Human attention lapses are particularly problematic and potentially catastrophic

        Attention is indeed complex and cannot be easily measured with single-modality

        could all play a part in attention lapses. To this end, we propose a pipeline

        tracking, fixation detection, third-person surveillance camera, and sound.

        neural networks (CNN) to interpret spatial semantic patterns in optical RGB
        images to directly estimate forest biomass, an essential climate parameter
        previously assessed from structural measures of trees. Trained with forest
        inventory plots, the CNN model demonstrates its learning via interpreting
        the composition of biomass at tree level, differing from traditional approaches
        reliant on conversions of aggregated parameters without explanatory rationale.
        The CNN approach yields consistently low bias across wide biomass ranges,
        whereas traditional models show insufficiency without information on tree
        height. Visually interpretable models link advanced computational tools with
        the power of data, facilitating the sustainable management of resources for

      abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently spearheaded by machine learning
        (ML) methods such as deep learning (DL) which have accelerated progress on
        many tasks thought to be out of reach of AI. These ML methods can often be
        compute hungry, energy intensive, and result in significant carbon emissions,
        a known driver of anthropogenic climate change. Additionally, the platforms
        on which ML systems run are associated with environmental impacts including
        and beyond carbon emissions. The solution lionized by both industry and the
        ML community to improve the environmental sustainability of ML is to increase
        the efficiency with which ML systems operate in terms of both compute and
        energy consumption. In this perspective, we argue that efficiency alone is
        not enough to make ML as a technology environmentally sustainable. We do so
        by presenting three high level discrepancies between the effect of efficiency
        on the environmental sustainability of ML when considering the many variables
        which it interacts with. In doing so, we comprehensively demonstrate, at multiple
        levels of granularity both technical and non-technical reasons, why efficiency
        is not enough to fully remedy the environmental impacts of ML. Based on this,
        we present and argue for systems thinking as a viable path towards improving
        the environmental sustainability of ML holistically.

      abstract: Landscape restoration initiatives are mainly focusing on forest regeneration
        and agroforestry especially in the Global South. However, due to a lack of
        monitoring tools, the carbon balance of restoration efforts remains poorly
        quantified. Here, we use satellite images from 2008 and 2019 to calculate
        carbon stocks for individual trees in Rwanda, a country which has been actively
        engaged in restoration activities over the past decade. We show that small-holder
        farmers on average planted about 3 trees per farm during 2008–2019, contributing
        about 50.4 million new trees at the national scale. The overall C sink of
        the new farmland trees was 0.13 Mg C ha− 1 yr− 1, which is 6 times lower than
        gains observed from restoration of degraded forests (0.76 Mg C ha− 1 yr− 1).
        If national greenhouse gas emissions remain at the level of 2019, agroforestry
        (~ 61% of national area coverage) and continued restoration of degraded natural
        forests (~ 0.5% of national area coverage) have the potential to offset about
        80% of the national emissions before 2050. Our work monitors and quantifies
        progress and impact of landscape restoration projects and outlines a pathway
        to engage smallholder farmers with a limited number of on-farm trees into
        the expanding carbon market.

      abstract: The “German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark” is a multi-category
        classification competition held at IJCNN 2011. Automatic recognition of traffic
        signs is required in advanced driver assistance systems and constitutes a
        challenging real-world computer vision and pattern recognition problem. A
        comprehensive, lifelike dataset of more than 50,000 traffic sign images has
        been collected. It reflects the strong variations in visual appearance of
        signs due to distance, illumination, weather conditions, partial occlusions,
        and rotations. The images are complemented by several precomputed feature
        sets to allow for applying machine learning algorithms without background

        class frequencies. Participants have to classify two test sets of more than

      abstract: Traffic signs are characterized by a wide variability in their visual
        appearance in real-world environments. For example, changes of illumination,
        varying weather conditions and partial occlusions impact the perception of
        road signs. In practice, a large number of different sign classes needs to
        be recognized with very high accuracy. Traffic signs have been designed to
        be easily readable for humans, who perform very well at this task. For computer
        systems, however, classifying traffic signs still seems to pose a challenging
        pattern recognition problem. Both image processing and machine learning algorithms
        are continuously refined to improve on this task. But little systematic comparison
        of such systems exist. What is the status quo? Do today’s algorithms reach

      abstract: Monotonicity constraints are powerful regularizers in statistical
        modelling. They can support fairness in computer supported decision making
        and increase plausibility in data-driven scientific models. The seminal min-max
        (MM) neural network architecture ensures monotonicity, but often gets stuck
        in undesired local optima during training because of vanishing gradients.
        We propose a simple modification of the MM network using strictly-increasing
        smooth non-linearities that alleviates this problem. The resulting smooth
        min-max (SMM) network module inherits the asymptotic approximation properties
        from the MM architecture. It can be used within larger deep learning systems
        trained end-to-end. The SMM module is considerably simpler and less computationally
        demanding than state-of-the-art neural networks for monotonic modelling. Still,
        in our experiments, it compared favorably to alternative neural and non-neural
        approaches in terms of generalization performance.

        best performing first-order learning methods for neural networks. We discuss
        modifications of this algorithm that improve its learning speed. The new optimization
        methods are empirically compared to the existing Rprop variants, the conjugate
        gradient method, Quickprop, and the BFGS algorithm on a set of neural network
        benchmark problems. The improved Rprop outperforms the other methods; only
        the BFGS performs better in the later stages of learning on some of the test
        problems. For the analysis of the local search behavior, we compare the Rprop
        algorithms on general hyperparabolic error landscapes, where the new variants
        confirm their improvement.

      abstract: Coreference resolution is the task of finding expressions that refer
        to the same entity in a text. Coreference models are generally trained on
        monolingual annotated data but annotating coreference is expensive and challenging.
        Hardmeier et al.(2013) have shown that parallel data contains latent anaphoric
        knowledge, but it has not been explored in end-to-end neural models yet. In
        this paper, we propose a simple yet effective model to exploit coreference
        knowledge from parallel data. In addition to the conventional modules learning
        coreference from annotations, we introduce an unsupervised module to capture
        cross-lingual coreference knowledge. Our proposed cross-lingual model achieves
        consistent improvements, up to 1.74 percentage points, on the OntoNotes 5.0
        English dataset using 9 different synthetic parallel datasets. These experimental
        results confirm that parallel data can provide additional coreference knowledge
        which is beneficial to coreference resolution tasks.

      abstract: 'Popular approaches for quantifying predictive uncertainty in deep
        neural networks often involve distributions over weights or multiple models,
        for instance via Markov Chain sampling, ensembling, or Monte Carlo dropout.
        These techniques usually incur overhead by having to train multiple model
        instances or do not produce very diverse predictions. This comprehensive and

        of models based on the concept of Evidential Deep Learning: For unfamiliar

        belief. Furthermore, they allow uncertainty estimation in a single model and
        forward pass by parameterizing distributions over distributions. This survey
        recapitulates existing works, focusing on the implementation in a classification
        setting, before surveying the application of the same paradigm to regression.

        based on pre-trained models and ensembles achieve the best results overall,
        the quality of uncertainty estimates can surprisingly suffer with more data.
        We also perform a qualitative analysis of uncertainties on sequences, discovering

      abstract: 'Speakers of different languages must attend to and encode strikingly
        different aspects of the world in order to use their language correctly (Sapir,
        1921; Slobin, 1996). One such difference is related to the way gender is expressed
        in a language. Saying "I am happy" in English, does not encode any additional
        knowledge of the speaker that uttered the sentence. However, many other languages
        do have grammatical gender systems and so such knowledge would be encoded.
        In order to correctly translate such a sentence into, say, French, the inherent
        gender information needs to be retained/recovered. The same sentence would
        become either "Je suis heureux", for a male speaker or "Je suis heureuse"
        for a female one. Apart from morphological agreement, demographic factors
        (gender, age, etc.) also influence our use of language in terms of word choices
        or even on the level of syntactic constructions (Tannen, 1991; Pennebaker
        et al., 2003). We integrate gender information into NMT systems. Our contribution
        is two-fold: (1) the compilation of large datasets with speaker information
        for 20 language pairs, and (2) a simple set of experiments that incorporate
        gender information into NMT for multiple language pairs. Our experiments show
        that adding a gender feature to an NMT system significantly improves the translation
        quality for some language pairs.'

        in different sentences. We use this model to integrate the output of a coreference

      abstract: A certain degree of predictability in criminal law is important for
        the overall functionality of the criminal justice system. For victims, the
        accused, and their relatives, predictability–and the lack thereof–has a more
        concrete and immediate impact. The lack of predictability of how and when
        cases are handled, and with what outcome, installs an uncertainty of significant
        events for those involved in the case. This effectively limits those persons’
        abilities to make decisions about their cases and their lives. Existing literature
        correspondingly shows that the process of a criminal case, its duration, and
        the uncertainty about the outcome represent a significant burden to those
        involved. There is a real need for legal and procedural empowerment. In this
        paper, we examine how statistical models increase predictability regarding
        sentencing outcomes and find that our models reduce the uncertainty of case
        outcomes for the accused, the victims, and their relatives.

      abstract: In heterogeneous treatment effect models with endogeneity, identification
        of the local average treatment effect (LATE) typically relies on the availability
        of an exogenous instrument monotonically related to treatment participation.
        First, we demonstrate that a strictly weaker local monotonicity condition—invoked
        for specific potential outcome values rather than globally—identifies the
        LATEs on compliers and defiers. Second, we show that our identification results
        apply to subsets of compliers and defiers when imposing an even weaker local
        compliers-defiers assumption that allows for both types at any potential outcome
        value. We propose estimators that are potentially more efficient than two-stage
        least squares (2SLS) in finite samples, even in cases where 2SLS is consistent.
        Finally, we provide an empirical application to estimating returns to education
        using the quarter of birth instrument.

        The decentralization process provides variation in the individual worker’s

        We find a wage premium associated with firm-level bargaining relative to sector-level
        bargaining and that the return to skills is higher under the more decentralized
        wage-setting systems. Using quantile regression, we also find that wages are
        more dispersed under firm-level bargaining compared to more centralized wage-setting
        systems.

        due to the possibility that smoking habits can be influenced through policy
        conduct. It is widely believed that maternal smoking reduces birthweight;
        however, the crucial difficulty in estimating such effects is the unobserved
        heterogeneity among mothers and the fact that estimation of conditional mean
        effects seems potentially inappropriate. We provide a unified view on the
        estimation of relationships between prenatal smoking and birthweight outcomes
        with quantile regression approaches for panel data and emphasize their differences.

      abstract: Exploiting a 1960s government trial in Copenhagen, we study the long-run
        and inter-generational effects of preventive care for toddlers. We combine
        administrative data with handwritten nurse records to document universal treatment
        take-up and positive health effects for treated children over the life course.
        Beneficial health impacts are largest for disadvantaged children and may even
        extend to their offspring. While initial trial cohorts experienced positive
        health and socioeconomic impacts, those are absent for the final cohorts.
        This heterogeneity across individuals' background and cohorts documents that
        universal toddler care can alleviate inequalities at low costs, and that the
        counterfactual policy environment matters.

      abstract: Within a flexible regression model (J.D. Hamilton, Econometrica 69
        (3) (2001) 537) we offer a battery of new Lagrange multiplier statistics that
        circumvent the problem of unidentified nuisance parameters under the null
        hypothesis of linearity and that are robust to the specification of the covariance
        function that defines the random field. These advantages are the result of
        (i) switching from the L2 to the L1 norm; and (ii) assuming that the random
        field is sufficiently smooth for its covariance function to be locally approximated
        by a high order Taylor expansion. A Monte Carlo simulation suggests that our
        statistics have superior power performance on detecting bilinear, neural network,
        and smooth transition autoregressive specifications. We also provide an application
        to the Industrial Production Index of sixteen OECD countries.

      abstract: Unobserved heterogeneity among childbearing women makes it difficult
        to isolate the causal effects of smoking and prenatal care on birth outcomes
        (such as birthweight). Whether a mother smokes, for instance, is likely to
        be correlated with unobserved characteristics of the mother. This article
        controls for such unobserved heterogeneity by using state-level panel data
        on maternally linked births. A quantile-estimation approach, motivated by
        a correlated random-effects model, is used to estimate the effects of smoking
        and other observables (number of prenatal-care visits, years of education,
        and so on) on the entire birthweight distribution.

        home visits by nurses in Finland, the UK and the USA, a similar service was

        Significant performance increases are achieved by encoding evidence, and by

      abstract: Explanations of neural models aim to reveal a model's decision-making
        process for its predictions. However, recent work shows that current methods
        giving explanations such as saliency maps or counterfactuals can be misleading,
        as they are prone to present reasons that are unfaithful to the model's inner
        workings. This work explores the challenging question of evaluating the faithfulness
        of natural language explanations (NLEs). To this end, we present two tests.
        First, we propose a counterfactual input editor for inserting reasons that
        lead to counterfactual predictions but are not reflected by the NLEs. Second,
        we reconstruct inputs from the reasons stated in the generated NLEs and check
        how often they lead to the same predictions. Our tests can evaluate emerging
        NLE models, proving a fundamental tool in the development of faithful NLEs.

      abstract: Recent developments in machine learning have introduced models that
        approach human performance at the cost of increased architectural complexity.
        Efforts to make the rationales behind the models' predictions transparent
        have inspired an abundance of new explainability techniques. Provided with
        an already trained model, they compute saliency scores for the words of an
        input instance. However, there exists no definitive guide on (i) how to choose
        such a technique given a particular application task and model architecture,
        and (ii) the benefits and drawbacks of using each such technique. In this
        paper, we develop a comprehensive list of diagnostic properties for evaluating
        existing explainability techniques. We then employ the proposed list to compare
        a set of diverse explainability techniques on downstream text classification
        tasks and neural network architectures. We also compare the saliency scores
        assigned by the explainability techniques with human annotations of salient
        input regions to find relations between a model's performance and the agreement
        of its rationales with human ones. Overall, we find that the gradient-based
        explanations perform best across tasks and model architectures, and we present
        further insights into the properties of the reviewed explainability techniques.

      abstract: Users may strive to formulate an adequate textual query for their
        information need. Search engines assist the users by presenting query suggestions.
        To preserve the original search intent, suggestions should be context-aware
        and account for the previous queries issued by the user. Achieving context
        awareness is challenging due to data sparsity. We present a novel hierarchical
        recurrent encoder-decoder architecture that makes possible to account for
        sequences of previous queries of arbitrary lengths. As a result, our suggestions
        are sensitive to the order of queries in the context while avoiding data sparsity.
        Additionally, our model can suggest for rare, or long-tail, queries. The produced
        suggestions are synthetic and are sampled one word at a time, using computationally
        cheap decoding techniques. This is in contrast to current synthetic suggestion

      abstract: Automatic language processing tools typically assign to terms so-called
        ‘weights’ corresponding to the contribution of terms to information content.
        Traditionally, term weights are computed from lexical statistics, e.g., term
        frequencies. We propose a new type of term weight that is computed from part
        of speech (POS) n-gram statistics. The proposed POS-based term weight represents
        how informative a term is in general, based on the ‘POS contexts’ in which
        it generally occurs in language. We suggest five different computations of
        POS-based term weights by extending existing statistical approximations of
        term information measures. We apply these POS-based term weights to information
        retrieval, by integrating them into the model that matches documents to queries.
        Experiments with two TREC collections and 300 queries, using TF-IDF & BM25

      abstract: The emerging classical-quantum transfer learning paradigm has brought
        a decent performance to quantum computational models in many tasks, such as
        computer vision, by enabling a combination of quantum models and classical
        pre-trained neural networks. However, using quantum computing with pre-trained
        models has yet to be explored in natural language processing (NLP). Due to
        the high linearity constraints of the underlying quantum computing infrastructures,
        existing Quantum NLP models are limited in performance on real tasks. We fill
        this gap by pre-training a sentence state with complex-valued BERT-like architecture,
        and adapting it to the classical-quantum transfer learning scheme for sentence
        classification. On quantum simulation experiments, the pre-trained representation
        can bring 50\% to 60\% increases to the capacity of end-to-end quantum models.

        optical fiber (mPOF) made of polycarbonate (PC), and report the first experimental
        demonstration of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) written in a PC optical fiber.
        The PC used in this work has a glass transition temperature of 145°C. We also
        characterize the mPOF optically and mechanically, and further test the sensitivity
        of the PC FBG to strain and temperature. We demonstrate that the PC FBG can
        bear temperatures as high as 125°C without malfunctioning. In contrast, polymethyl
        methacrylate-based FBG technology is generally limited to temperatures below
        90°C.

      abstract: Variation of the brain temperature is strongly affected by blood flow,
        oxygen supply, and neural cell metabolism. Localized monitoring of the brain
        temperature is one of the most effective ways to correlate brain functions
        and diseases such as stroke, epilepsy, and mood disorders. While polymer optical
        fibers (POFs) are considered ideal candidates for temperature sensing in the
        brain, they have never been used so far in vivo. Here, we developed for the
        first, to the best of our knowledge, time an implantable probe based on a
        microstructured polymer optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor for intracranial
        brain temperature mapping. The temperature at different depths of the brain
        (starting from the cerebral cortex) and the correlation between the brain
        and body core temperature of a rat were recorded with a sensitivity of 33
        pm/°C and accuracy <0.2°C. Our in vivo experimental results suggest that the

      abstract: Brain temperature is a vital physiological parameter that has a great
        effect on metabolic processes, enzymatic activity, neurotransmitter function,
        blood flow regulation, neuroprotection, and cognitive performance. In this
        framework, the development of accurate and reliable brain temperature measurement
        tools is crucial in brain-related treatment and research, such as neurosurgery,
        therapeutic hypothermia, and the understanding of brain function and pathologies.
        Here, we developed the first large-core flexible low optical loss CYTOP polymer
        optical fiber (POF)-based brain temperature probe operating in the telecommunication
        spectral range. The temperature measurements were achieved by detecting the
        reflected spectrum from a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) directly inscribed at
        the tip of the POF using femtosecond pulses. A fluorinated ethylene propylene
        (FEP) tube was thermally drawn and used as a sleeve …

      abstract: In the quest of finding the ideal polymer optical fiber (POF) for
        Bragg grating sensing, we have fabricated and characterized an endlessly single
        mode microstructured POF (mPOF). This fiber is made from cyclo-olefin homopolymer
        Zeonex grade 480R which has a very high glass transition temperature of 138
        °C and is humidity insensitive. It represents a significant improvement with
        respect to the also humidity insensitive Topas core fibers, in that Zeonex
        fibers are easier to manufacture, has better transmittance, higher sensitivity
        to temperature and better mechanical stability at high temperature. Furthermore,
        Zeonex has very good compatibility with PMMA in terms of dilatation coefficients
        for co-drawing applications. The Zeonex mPOF has a core and cladding diameter
        of 8.8 µm and 150 µm, respectively, with a hole to pitch ratio of 0.4 and
        a minimum propagation loss of 2.34 ± 0.39 dB/m at 690.78 nm. We have also

      abstract: In this work we perform multimodal detection and classification of
        head movements from face to face video conversation data. We have experimented
        with different models and feature sets and provided some insight on the effect
        of independent features, but also how their interaction can enhance a head
        movement classifier. Used features include nose, neck and mid hip position
        coordinates and their derivatives together with acoustic features, namely,
        intensity and pitch of the speaker on focus. Results show that when input
        features are sufficiently processed by interacting with each other, a linear
        classifier can reach a similar performance to a more complex non-linear neural
        model with several hidden layers. Our best models achieve state-of-the-art
        performance in the detection task, measured by macro-averaged F1 score.

      abstract: 'The paper compares how feedback is expressed via speech and head
        movements in comparable corpora of first encounters in three Nordic languages:
        Danish, Finnish and Swedish. The three corpora have been collected following
        common guidelines, and they have been annotated according to the same scheme
        in the NOMCO project. The results of the comparison show that in this data
        the most frequent feedback-related head movement is Nod in all three languages.
        Two types of Nods were distinguished in all corpora: Downnods and Up-nods;
        the participants from the three countries use Down-and Up-nods with different
        frequency. In particular, Danes use Down-nods more frequently than Finns and
        Swedes, while Swedes use Up-nods more frequently than Finns and Danes. Finally,
        Finns use more often single Nods than repeated Nods, differing from the Swedish
        and Danish participants. The differences in the frequency of both Down-nods
        and Up-Nods in the Danish, Finnish and Swedish interactions are interesting
        given that Nordic countries are not only geographically near, but are also
        considered to be very similar culturally. Finally, a comparison of feedbackrelated

        and extends to more data the work proposed in . Gestures contribute to the
        successful delivery of a message in face-to-face communication by reinforcing
        what is conveyed by speech or adding new information to it. Gestures are multi-functional
        and can have different meanings depending on the context. The identification
        of the semiotic type of gestures is the first step towards their automatic
        interpretation. Moreover, exploiting the relation between gesture form and

      abstract: Virtual analog (VA) audio effects are increasingly based on neural
        networks and deep learning frameworks. Due to the underlying black-box methodology,
        a successful model will learn to approximate the data it is presented, including
        potential errors such as latency and audio dropouts as well as non-linear
        characteristics and frequency-dependent phase shifts produced by the hardware.
        The latter is of particular interest as the learned phase-response might cause
        unwanted audible artifacts when the effect is used for creative processing
        techniques such as dry-wet mixing or parallel compression. To overcome these
        artifacts we propose differentiable signal processing tools and deep optimization
        structures for automatically tuning all-pass filters to predict the phase
        response of different VA simulations, and align processed signals that are
        out of phase. The approaches are assessed using objective metrics while listening
        tests evaluate their ability to enhance the quality of parallel path processing
        techniques. Ultimately, an over-parameterized, BiasNet-based, all-pass model
        is proposed for the optimization problem under consideration, resulting in
        models that can estimate all-pass filter coefficients to align a dry signal
        with its affected, wet, equivalent.

        for both music and speech. However, the quality of a shifted signal is heavily
        dependent on both vertical and horizontal phase coherence, which might make
        the output sound” phasy” and” smeared”. This project investigates different
        techniques to further extend an already complex phase vocoder, using new phase-locking
        algorithms, true envelope improvements and transient preservation methods.
        The extensions are evaluated against the their original counterparts and finally
        compared to a state-of-the art commercial pitch/formant shifter.

      abstract: We explore two approaches to creatively altering vocal timbre using
        Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP). The first approach is inspired
        by classic cross-synthesis techniques. A pretrained DDSP decoder predicts
        a filter for a noise source and a harmonic distribution, based on pitch and
        loudness information extracted from the vocal input. Before synthesis, the
        harmonic distribution is modified by interpolating between the predicted distribution
        and the harmonics of the input. We provide a real-time implementation of this
        approach in the form of a Neutone model. In the second approach, autoencoder
        models are trained on datasets consisting of both vocal and instrument training
        data. To apply the effect, the trained autoencoder attempts to reconstruct
        the vocal input. We find that there is a desirable "sweet spot" during training,
        where the model has learned to reconstruct the phonetic content of the input
        vocals, but is still affected by the timbre of the instrument mixed into the
        training data. After further training, that effect disappears. A perceptual
        evaluation compares the two approaches. We find that the autoencoder in the
        second approach is able to reconstruct intelligible lyrical content without
        any explicit phonetic information provided during training.

        in neural network pruning methods to recurrent black-box models of distortion
        effects using a Long Short-Term Memory architecture. We compare the efficacy
        of the method on four different datasets; one distortion pedal and three vacuum
        tube amplifiers. Iterative magnitude pruning allows us to remove over 99%
        of parameters from some models without a loss of accuracy. We evaluate the
        real-time performance of the pruned models and find that a 3x-4x speedup can
        be achieved, compared to an unpruned baseline. We show that …

      abstract: Sound synthesis based on physical modeling of stringed instruments
        has been an active research field for the last decade. The most efficient
        synthe-sis models have been obtained using the theory of digital waveguides
        (Smith 1992). Commuted waveguide synthesis (Smith 1993; Karjalainen et al.
        1993) is based on the linearity and time-invariance of the synthesis model
        and is an important method for developing a generic string instrument model.
        Recently, such a model has been presented including consolidated pluck and
        body wavetables, a pluck-shaping filter, a pluck-position comb filter, string
        models with loop filters and continuously variable delays, and sympathetic
        couplings between the strings (Karjalainen et al. 1998). Our model is realized
        in a real-time software synthesizer called PWSynth. PWSynth is a user li-brary
        for PatchWork (Laurson 1996) that attempts to effectively integrate computer-assisted

      abstract: The rapid development and availability of low-cost technologies have
        created a wide interest in virtual reality. In the field of computer music,
        the term “virtual musical instruments” has been used for a long time to describe
        software simulations, extensions of existing musical instruments, and ways
        to control them with new interfaces for musical expression. Virtual reality
        musical instruments (VRMIs) that include a simulated visual component delivered
        via a head-mounted display or other forms of immersive visualization have
        not yet received much attention. In this article, we present a field overview
        of VRMIs from the viewpoint of the performer. We propose nine design guidelines,
        describe evaluation methods, analyze case studies, and consider future challenges.

      abstract: Digital waveguides and finite difference time domain schemes have
        been used in physical modeling of spatially distributed systems. Both of them
        are known to provide exact modeling of ideal one-dimensional (1D) band-limited
        wave propagation, and both of them can be composed to approximate two-dimensional
        (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) mesh structures. Their equal capabilities
        in physical modeling have been shown for special cases and have been assumed
        to cover generalized cases as well. The ability to form mixed models by joining
        substructures of both classes through converter elements has been proposed
        recently. In this paper, we formulate a general digital signal processing
        (DSP)-oriented framework where the functional equivalence of these two approaches
        is systematically elaborated and the conditions of building mixed models are
        studied. An example of mixed modeling of a 2D …

      abstract: This article describes physical modelling techniques that can be used
        for simulating musical instruments. The methods are closely related to digital
        signal processing. They discretize the system with respect to time, because
        the aim is to run the simulation using a computer. The physics-based modelling
        methods can be classified as mass–spring, modal, wave digital, finite difference,
        digital waveguide and source–filter models. We present the basic theory and
        a discussion on possible extensions for each modelling technique. For some
        methods, a simple model example is chosen from the existing literature demonstrating
        a typical use of the method. For instance, in the case of the digital waveguide
        modelling technique a vibrating string model is discussed, and in the case
        of the wave digital filter technique we present a classical piano hammer model.

      abstract: As the next generation of active video games (AVG) and virtual reality
        (VR) systems enter people’s lives, designers may wrongly aim for an experience
        decoupled from bodies. However, both AVG and VR clearly afford opportunities
        to bring experiences, technologies, and users’ physical and experiential bodies
        together, and to study and teach these open-ended relationships of enaction
        and meaning-making in the framework of embodied interaction. Without such
        a framework, an aesthetic pleasure, lasting satisfaction, and enjoyment would
        be impossible to achieve in designing sonic interactions in virtual environments
        (SIVE). In this chapter, we introduce this framework and focus on design exemplars
        that come from a soma design ideation workshop and balance rehabilitation.
        Within the field of physiotherapy, developing new conceptual interventions,
        with a more patientcentered approach, is still scarce but has huge potential
        for overcoming some of the challenges facing health care. We indicate how
        the tactics such as making space, subtle guidance, defamiliarization, and
        intimate correspondence have informed the exemplars, both in the workshop
        and also in our ongoing physiotherapy case. Implications for these tactics
        and design strategies for our design, as well as for general practitioners
        of SIVE are outlined.

        towards a more sustainable energy system. Evidence-based decision-making regarding
        such policies needs a solid knowledge foundation. We take stock of our existing
        knowledge regarding the statistics and data that form the basis for research,
        policy and business decision-making regarding investments in renewable energy

        addressing these problems is not simply a matter of intensifying existing

        difficulties. We particularly emphasize the role of investors as a linkage
        between public policy and firm-level activity, discussing the kind of data

        from natural language processing with nearest-neighbor approximation. Using
        this methodology, we are able to compute similarities between all existing

        a technological network. We validate both technological signature and similarity
        in various ways and, using the case of electric vehicle technologies, demonstrate
        their usefulness in measuring knowledge flows, mapping technological change,
        and creating patent quality indicators. This paper contributes to the growing

      abstract: Predictive analytics is becoming more mature and is gaining traction
        in smart manufacturing around the world. Over the past decade, predictive
        analytics has hence reached a plateau of productivity while techniques and
        tools became more robust and accessible. Small- and medium-sized enterprises
        have to seize these new opportunities in order to optimize and embed analytics
        in high-value business scenarios and improve their competitiveness. However,
        getting started with predictive modeling can seem like an insurmountable feat
        for SMEs, why inspiration and pointers to real-world applications can be valuable.
        In this paper, we first introduce current trends in predictive analytics followed
        by a mini survey showcasing interesting real-world use cases in SMEs. Finally,
        we present common algorithms and models, followed by two recent real-world

      abstract: Patent data is an important source of knowledge for innovation research.
        While the technological similarity between pairs of patents is a key enabling
        indicator for patent analysis. Recently researchers have been using patent
        vector space models based on different NLP embeddings models to calculate
        technological similarity between pairs of patents to help better understand
        innovations, patent landscaping, technology mapping, and patent quality evaluation.
        To the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive survey that builds
        a big picture of embedding models' performance for calculating patent similarity
        indicators. Therefore, in this study, we provide an overview of the accuracy
        of these algorithms based on patent classification performance. In a detailed
        discussion, we report the performance of the top 3 algorithms at section,
        class, and subclass levels. The results based on the first claim of patents
        show that PatentSBERTa, Bert-for-patents, and TF-IDF Weighted Word Embeddings
        have the best accuracy for computing sentence embeddings at the subclass level.
        According to the first results, the performance of the models in different
        classes varies which shows researchers in patent analysis can utilize the
        results of this study for choosing the best proper model based on the specific
        section of patent data they used.

        that are automatically extracted from a large text corpus. We identify these

        methods, applications and other scientific terminology. We create a large
        amount of search queries based on combinations of method- and application-keywords,
        which we use to conduct semantic search and identify related patents. By doing
        so, we aim at contributing to the growing body of research on text-based technology

      abstract: Compositional generalization allows efficient learning and human-like
        inductive biases. Since most research investigating compositional generalization
        in NLP is done on English, important questions remain underexplored. Do the
        necessary compositional generalization abilities differ across languages?
        Can models compositionally generalize cross-lingually? As a first step to
        answering these questions, recent work used neural machine translation to
        translate datasets for evaluating compositional generalization in semantic
        parsing. However, we show that this entails critical semantic distortion.
        To address this limitation, we craft a faithful rule-based translation of
        the MCWQ dataset from English to Chinese and Japanese. Even with the resulting
        robust benchmark, which we call MCWQ-R, we show that the distribution of compositions
        still suffers due to linguistic divergences, and that multilingual models
        still struggle with cross-lingual compositional generalization. Our dataset
        and methodology will be useful resources for the study of cross-lingual compositional
        generalization in other tasks.

      abstract: Hyperbole is a common figure of speech, which is under-explored in
        NLP research. In this study, we conduct edge and minimal description length
        (MDL) probing experiments on three pre-trained language models (PLMs) in an
        attempt to explore the extent to which hyperbolic information is encoded in
        these models. We use both word-in-context and sentence-level representations
        as model inputs as a basis for comparison. We also annotate 63 hyperbole sentences
        from the HYPO dataset according to an operational taxonomy to conduct an error
        analysis to explore the encoding of different hyperbole categories. Our results
        show that hyperbole is to a limited extent encoded in PLMs, and mostly in
        the final layers. They also indicate that hyperbolic information may be better
        encoded by the sentence-level representations, which, due to the pragmatic
        nature of hyperbole, may therefore provide a more accurate and informative
        representation in PLMs. Finally, the inter-annotator agreement for our annotations,
        a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.339, suggest that the taxonomy categories may not be
        intuitive and need revision or simplification.

      abstract: Hyperbole is a common figure of speech, which is under-explored in
        NLP research. In this study, we conduct edge and minimal description length
        (MDL) probing experiments on three pre-trained language models (PLMs) in an
        attempt to explore the extent to which hyperbolic information is encoded in
        these models. We use both word-in-context and sentence-level representations
        as model inputs as a basis for comparison. We also annotate 63 hyperbole sentences
        from the HYPO dataset according to an operational taxonomy to conduct an error
        analysis to explore the encoding of different hyperbole categories. Our results
        show that hyperbole is to a limited extent encoded in PLMs, and mostly in
        the final layers. They also indicate that hyperbolic information may be better
        encoded by the sentence-level representations, which, due to the pragmatic
        nature of hyperbole, may therefore provide a more accurate and informative
        representation in PLMs. Finally, the inter-annotator agreement for our annotations,
        a Cohen's Kappa of 0.339, suggest that the taxonomy categories may not be
        intuitive and need revision or simplification.

      abstract: Chinese geographic re-ranking task aims to find the most relevant
        addresses among retrieved candidates, which is crucial for location-related
        services such as navigation maps. Unlike the general sentences, geographic
        contexts are closely intertwined with geographical concepts, from general
        spans (e.g., province) to specific spans (e.g., road). Given this feature,
        we propose an innovative framework, namely Geo-Encoder, to more effectively
        integrate Chinese geographical semantics into re-ranking pipelines. Our methodology
        begins by employing off-the-shelf tools to associate text with geographical
        spans, treating them as chunking units. Then, we present a multi-task learning
        module to simultaneously acquire an effective attention matrix that determines
        chunk contributions to extra semantic representations. Furthermore, we put
        forth an asynchronous update mechanism for the proposed addition task, aiming
        to guide the model capable of effectively focusing on specific chunks. Experiments
        on two distinct Chinese geographic re-ranking datasets, show that the Geo-Encoder
        achieves significant improvements when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
        Notably, it leads to a substantial improvement in the Hit@1 score of MGEO-BERT,
        increasing it by 6.22% from 62.76 to 68.98 on the GeoTES dataset.

      abstract: 'We present the first parser for UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable
        framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological
        work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing
        techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures), discontinuous
        structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex semantic units.
        To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is not supported
        by any existing parser. Our transition-based parser, which uses a novel transition
        set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs, has value not just for UCCA
        parsing: its ability to handle more general graph structures can inform the
        development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures, and in languages
        that frequently use discontinuous structures.'

      abstract: 'Humans can effortlessly understand the coordinate structure of sentences
        such as "Niels Bohr and Kurt Cobain were born in Copenhagen and Seattle, respectively".
        In the context of natural language inference (NLI), we examine how language
        models (LMs) reason with respective readings (Gawron and Kehler, 2004) from
        two perspectives: syntactic-semantic and commonsense-world knowledge. We propose
        a controlled synthetic dataset WikiResNLI and a naturally occurring dataset
        NatResNLI to encompass various explicit and implicit realizations of "respectively".
        We show that fine-tuned NLI models struggle with understanding such readings
        without explicit supervision. While few-shot learning is easy in the presence
        of explicit cues, longer training is required when the reading is evoked implicitly,
        leaving models to rely on common sense inferences. Furthermore, our fine-grained
        analysis indicates models fail to generalize across different constructions.
        To conclude, we demonstrate that LMs still lag behind humans in generalizing
        to the long tail of linguistic constructions.'

      abstract: Over the past 10 years mobile learning has grown from a minor research
        interest to a set of significant projects in schools, workplaces, museums,
        cities and rural areas around the world. Each project has shown how mobile
        technology can offer new opportunities for learning that extend within and
        beyond the traditional teacher-led classroom. Yet, the very diversity of the
        projects makes it difficult to capture the essence of mobile learning or to
        show how it contributes to the theory and practice of education. This chapter
        attempts to address the central issues of what is mobile learning and how
        can it be designed and evaluated. Drawing on a theory of mobile learning as
        “the processes of coming to know through conversations across multiple contexts
        amongst people and personal interactive technologies” (Sharples 2007 p. 225),
        we discuss how learning contexts are created through interaction and how portable

        learning (CSCL) setting to improve students’ engagement with massive courses.
        Although the peer feedback process increases students’ self-regulatory practice,
        metacognition, and academic achievement, instructors need to go through large
        amounts of feedback text data which is much more time-consuming. To address
        this challenge, the present study proposes an automated content analysis approach

      abstract: Understanding and improving education are critical goals of learning
        analytics. However, learning is not always mediated or aided by a digital
        system that can capture digital traces. Learning in such environments can
        be studied by recording, processing, and analyzing different signals, including
        video and audio, so that traces of actors’ actions and interactions are captured.
        Multimodal Learning Analytics refers to analyzing these signals through the
        use and integration of these multiple modes. However, a need exists to evaluate
        how research is conducted in the emerging field of multimodal learning analytics
        to aid and evaluate how these systems work. With the growth of multimodal
        learning analytics, research trends and technologies are needed to support

      abstract: Even though computer science is currently being integrated into primary
        and secondary education worldwide, we cannot yet make assumptions about our
        student's prior knowledge of computing. Every student might have different
        conceptions about the field of study they are about to enter. Students start
        at computer science programs with different prior experiences with programming,
        ranging from no experience to a high degree of proficiency. At the Department
        of Computer Science, University of BLINDED, we have designed a two-week voluntary
        summer kickstart course in programming to help students in this transition
        into our three computer science programs. To evaluate the course, we followed
        three groups of students. Group one with no/limited programming experience
        attended the kickstart course. The second group with no/little programming
        experience did not participate in the course, and the third group of students
        with programming experience did not participate in the class. We observed
        the kickstart course and conducted interviews. We followed up about three
        weeks after the start of the semester and then again at the end of the semester
        in December. Our findings suggest that the course reduces the gap in programming
        experiences and strengthens students' self-efficacy and sense of belonging.
        However, the approach creates a social gap between students who have not attended
        the course with no/limited experience at the beginning of the semester. Even
        though the students in December do not experience any difference between students
        who have attended the course and those who have not, it is important to consider
        this social …

      abstract: Events like hackathons, maker events, game jams, and similar time-bounded
        events are a global phenomenon. They provide a space for people with different
        backgrounds and expertise to come together and work on projects that interest
        them (Falk et al., 2022). These events are usually centered around specific
        themes or challenges. They encourage participants to form teams and use their
        skills and creativity to develop innovative prototypes by choosing their own
        tools and approaches. During such events, teams typically have access to mentors
        to aid them in their projects.While many of these events may not be specifically
        designed to promote learning, they can still offer valuable opportunities
        for participants to expand their knowledge. We can expect that these events
        are a rich source of “collateral learning” defined by Dewey (1938) as “the
        way of formation of enduring attitudes, of likes and dislikes.” For example,
        participants may learn about new tools and technologies (Huppenkothen et al.,
        2018), gain experience collaborating in a team (Mendes et al., 2022), or expand
        their knowledge related to the theme of an event (Affia et al., 2020). Additionally,
        these events can help participants expand their networks and connect with
        others in their field and beyond.

        an extremely low speech intelligibility for untrained lip readers. In this

        algorithm. To improve speech reconstruction performance, our model is also
        trained to predict text information in a multi-task learning fashion and it
        is able to simultaneously reconstruct and recognise speech in real time. The

        of sensors to monitor physical processes, such as the environment and industrial
        manufacturing processes, where they provide data for predictive maintenance,
        anomaly detection, or similar. The sensor devices are typically resource-constrained

        for data processing. However, the capacity of the wireless link and their
        power constraints limit the amount of data that can be transmitted to the

        attention to further optimize the utilization of manufacturing and production

      abstract: Audio-visual speech enhancement (SE) is the task of reducing the acoustic
        background noise in a degraded speech signal using both acoustic and visual
        information. In this work, we study how to incorporate visual information
        to enhance a speech signal using acoustic beamformers in hearing aids (HAs).
        Specifically, we first trained a deep learning model to estimate a time-frequency
        mask from audio-visual data. Then, we apply this mask to estimate the inter-microphone
        power spectral densities (PSDs) of the clean and the noise signal. Finally,
        we used the estimated PSDs to build acoustic beamformers. Assuming that a
        HA user wears an add-on device comprising a camera pointing at the target
        speaker, we show that our method can be beneficial for HA systems especially
        at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs).

      abstract: Reducing the number of comparisons in automated fingerprint identification
        systems is essential when dealing with a large database. Fingerprint classification
        allows to achieve this goal by dividing fingerprints into several categories,
        but it presents still some challenges due to the large intra-class variations
        and the small inter-class variations. The vast majority of the previous methods
        uses global characteristics, in particular the orientation image, as features
        of a classifier. This makes the feature extraction stage highly dependent
        on preprocessing techniques and usually computationally expensive. In this
        work we evaluate the performance of two pre-trained convolutional neural networks
        fine-tuned on the NIST SD4 benchmark database. The obtained results show that
        this approach is comparable with other results in the literature, with the
        advantage of a fast feature extraction stage.

      abstract: When speaking in presence of background noise, humans reflexively
        change their way of speaking in order to improve the intelligibility of their
        speech. This reflex is known as Lombard effect. Collecting speech in Lombard
        conditions is usually hard and costly. For this reason, speech enhancement
        systems are generally trained and evaluated on speech recorded in quiet to
        which noise is artificially added. Since these systems are often used in situations
        where Lombard speech occurs, in this work we perform an analysis of the impact
        that Lombard effect has on audio, visual and audio-visual speech enhancement,
        focusing on deep-learning-based systems, since they represent the current
        state of the art in the field. We conduct several experiments using an audio-visual
        Lombard speech corpus consisting of utterances spoken by 54 different talkers.

      abstract: 'Improving speech system performance in noisy environments remains
        a challenging task, and speech enhancement (SE) is one of the effective techniques
        to solve the problem. Motivated by the promising results of generative adversarial
        networks (GANs) in a variety of image processing tasks, we explore the potential
        of conditional GANs (cGANs) for SE, and in particular, we make use of the
        image processing framework proposed by Isola et al. [1] to learn a mapping
        from the spectrogram of noisy speech to an enhanced counterpart. The SE cGAN
        consists of two networks, trained in an adversarial manner: a generator that
        tries to enhance the input noisy spectrogram, and a discriminator that tries
        to distinguish between enhanced spectrograms provided by the generator and
        clean ones from the database using the noisy spectrogram as a condition. We
        evaluate the performance of the cGAN method in terms of perceptual evaluation
        of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and
        equal error rate (EER) of speaker verification (an example application). Experimental
        results show that the cGAN method overall outperforms the classical short-time
        spectral amplitude minimum mean square error (STSA-MMSE) SE algorithm, and
        is comparable to a deep neural network-based SE approach (DNN-SE).'

      abstract: Low-complexity neural networks (NNs) have successfully been applied
        for digital signal processing (DSP) in short-reach intensity-modulated directly
        detected optical links, where chromatic dispersion-induced impairments significantly
        limit the transmission distance. The NN-based equalizers are usually optimized
        independently from other DSP components, such as matched filtering. This approach
        may result in lower equalization performance. Alternatively, optimizing a
        NN equalizer to perform functionalities of multiple DSP blocks may increase
        transmission reach while keeping the complexity low. In this work, we propose
        a low-complexity NN that performs samples-to-symbol equalization, meaning
        that the NN-based equalizer includes match filtering and downsampling. We
        compare it to a samples-to-sample equalization approach followed by match
        filtering and downsampling in terms of performance and computational complexity.
        Both approaches are evaluated using three different types of NNs combined
        with optical preprocessing. We numerically and experimentally show that the
        proposed samples-to-symbol equalization approach applied for 32 GBd on-off
        keying (OOK) signals outperforms the samples-domain alternative keeping the
        computational complexity low. Additionally, the different types of NN-based
        equalizers are compared in terms of performance with respect to computational
        complexity.

      abstract: It is widely acknowledged that the phase noise of an optical frequency
        comb primarily stems from the common mode (carrier-envelope) and the repetition
        rate phase noise. However, owing to technical noise sources or other intricate
        intra-cavity factors, residual phase noise components, distinct from the common
        mode and the repetition rate phase noise, may also exist. We introduce a measurement
        technique that combines subspace tracking and multi-heterodyne coherent detection
        for the separation of different phase noise sources. This method allows us
        to break down the overall phase noise sources associated with a specific comb-line
        into distinct phase noise components associated with the common mode, the
        repetition rate and the residual phase noise terms. The measurement method

      abstract: 'Comparison among graphs is ubiquitous in graph analytics. However,
        it is a hard task in terms of the expressiveness of the employed similarity
        measure and the efficiency of its computation. Ideally, graph comparison should
        be invariant to the order of nodes and the sizes of compared graphs, adaptive
        to the scale of graph patterns, and scalable. Unfortunately, these properties
        have not been addressed together. Graph comparisons still rely on direct approaches,
        graph kernels, or representation-based methods, which are all inefficient
        and impractical for large graph collections. In this paper, we propose the
        Network Laplacian Spectral Descriptor (NetLSD): the first, to our knowledge,

      abstract: Community detection finds homogeneous groups of nodes in a graph.
        Existing approaches either partition the graph into disjoint, non-overlapping,
        communities, or determine only overlapping communities. To date, no method
        supports both detections of overlapping and non-overlapping communities. We
        propose UCoDe, a unified method for community detection in attributed graphs
        that detects both overlapping and non-overlapping communities by means of
        a novel contrastive loss that captures node similarity on a macro-scale. Our
        thorough experimental assessment on real data shows that, regardless of the
        data distribution, our method is either the top performer or among the top
        performers in both overlapping and non-overlapping detection without burdensome
        hyper-parameter tuning.

      abstract: We propose a principled optimization-based interactive query relaxation
        framework for queries that return no answers. Given an initial query that
        returns an empty answer set, our framework dynamically computes and suggests
        alternative queries with less conditions than those the user has initially
        requested, in order to help the user arrive at a query with a non-empty answer,
        or at a query for which no matter how many additional conditions are ignored,
        the answer will still be empty. Our proposed approach for suggesting query
        relaxations is driven by a novel probabilistic framework based on optimizing
        a wide variety of application-dependent objective functions. We describe optimal
        and approximate solutions of different optimization problems using the framework.
        We analyze these solutions, experimentally verify their efficiency and effectiveness,
        and illustrate their advantage over the existing approaches.

      abstract: 'The ability to generalise well is one of the primary desiderata of
        natural language processing NLP). Yet, what `good generalisation'' entails
        and how it should be evaluated is not well understood, nor are there any common
        standards to evaluate it. In this paper, we aim to lay the ground-work to
        improve both of these issues. We present a taxonomy for characterising and
        understanding generalisation research in NLP, we use that taxonomy to present
        a comprehensive map of published generalisation studies, and we make recommendations
        for which areas might deserve attention in the future. Our taxonomy is based
        on an extensive literature review of generalisation research, and contains
        five axes along which studies can differ: their main motivation, the type
        of generalisation they aim to solve, the type of data shift they consider,
        the source by which this data shift is obtained, and the locus of the shift
        within the modelling pipeline. We use our taxonomy to classify over 400 previous
        papers that test generalisation, for a total of more than 600 individual experiments.
        Considering the results of this review, we present an in-depth analysis of
        the current state of generalisation research in NLP, and make recommendations
        for the future. Along with this paper, we release a webpage where the results
        of our review can be dynamically explored, and which we intend to up-date
        as new NLP generalisation studies are published. With this work, we aim to

        (or, conversely, uncertainty) of a neural classifier through the lens of low-resource
        languages. By training models on sub-sampled datasets in three different languages,
        we assess the quality of estimates from a wide array of approaches and their

        based on pre-trained models and ensembles achieve the best results overall,
        the quality of uncertainty estimates can surprisingly suffer with more data.
        We also perform a qualitative analysis of uncertainties on sequences, discovering

        by its data uncertainty, not model uncertainty. All model implementations
        are open-sourced in a software package.

      abstract: 'Popular approaches for quantifying predictive uncertainty in deep
        neural networks often involve distributions over weights or multiple models,
        for instance via Markov Chain sampling, ensembling, or Monte Carlo dropout.
        These techniques usually incur overhead by having to train multiple model
        instances or do not produce very diverse predictions. This comprehensive and

      abstract: Recent advances of powerful Language Models have allowed Natural Language
        Generation (NLG) to emerge as an important technology that can not only perform
        traditional tasks like summarisation or translation, but also serve as a natural
        language interface to a variety of applications. As such, it is crucial that
        NLG systems are trustworthy and reliable, for example by indicating when they
        are likely to be wrong; and supporting multiple views, backgrounds and writing
        styles -- reflecting diverse human sub-populations. In this paper, we argue
        that a principled treatment of uncertainty can assist in creating systems
        and evaluation protocols better aligned with these goals. We first present
        the fundamental theory, frameworks and vocabulary required to represent uncertainty.
        We then characterise the main sources of uncertainty in NLG from a linguistic
        perspective, and propose a two-dimensional taxonomy that is more informative
        and faithful than the popular aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy. Finally, we move
        from theory to applications and highlight exciting research directions that
        exploit uncertainty to power decoding, controllable generation, self-assessment,
        selective answering, active learning and more.

        analyzing this problem on medical data, especially on mixed-type tabular data
        such as Electronic Health Records. We close this gap by presenting a series
        of tests including a large variety of contemporary uncertainty estimation
        techniques, in order to determine whether they are able to identify out-ofdistribution
        (OOD) patients. In contrast to previous work, we design tests on realistic
        and clinically relevant OOD groups, and run experiments on real-world medical
        data. We find that almost all techniques fail to achieve convincing results,
        partly disagreeing with earlier findings.

        improve reproducibility and support scientific progress. These standards are

      abstract: A crucial requirement for reliable deployment of deep learning models
        for safety-critical applications is the ability to identify out-of-distribution
        (OOD) data points, samples which differ from the training data and on which
        a model might underperform. Previous work has attempted to tackle this problem
        using uncertainty estimation techniques. However, there is empirical evidence
        that a large family of these techniques do not detect OOD reliably in classification
        tasks. This paper gives a theoretical explanation for said experimental findings
        and illustrates it on synthetic data. We prove that such techniques are not
        able to reliably identify OOD samples in a classification setting, since their
        level of confidence is generalized to unseen areas of the feature space. This
        result stems from the interplay between the representation of ReLU networks
        as piece-wise affine transformations, the saturating nature of activation
        functions like softmax, and the most widely-used uncertainty metrics.

      abstract: Describing the main event of an image involves identifying the objects
        depicted and predicting the relationships between them. Previous approaches
        have represented images as unstructured bags of regions, which makes it difficult
        to accurately predict meaningful relationships between regions. In this paper,
        we introduce visual dependency representations to capture the relationships
        between the objects in an image, and hypothesize that this representation
        can improve image description. We test this hypothesis using a new data set
        of region-annotated images, associated with visual dependency representations
        and gold-standard descriptions. We describe two template-based description
        generation models that operate over visual dependency representations. In
        an image description task, we find that these models outperform approaches
        that rely on object proximity or corpus information to generate descriptions

      abstract: Multilingual image captioning has recently been tackled by training
        with large-scale machine translated data, which is an expensive, noisy, and
        time-consuming process. Without requiring any multilingual caption data, we
        propose LMCap, an image-blind few-shot multilingual captioning model that
        works by prompting a language model with retrieved captions. Specifically,
        instead of following the standard encoder-decoder paradigm, given an image,
        LMCap first retrieves the captions of similar images using a multilingual
        CLIP encoder. These captions are then combined into a prompt for an XGLM decoder,
        in order to generate captions in the desired language. In other words, the
        generation model does not directly process the image, instead processing retrieved
        captions. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset of geographically diverse images
        show that our model is competitive with fully-supervised multilingual captioning
        models, without requiring any supervised training on any captioning data.

      abstract: Recent advances in image captioning have focused on scaling the data
        and model size, substantially increasing the cost of pre-training and finetuning.
        As an alternative to large models, we present SmallCap, which generates a
        caption conditioned on an input image and related captions retrieved from
        a datastore. Our model is lightweight and fast to train as the only learned
        parameters are in newly introduced cross-attention layers between a pre-trained
        CLIP encoder and GPT-2 decoder. SmallCap can transfer to new domains without
        additional finetuning and can exploit large-scale data in a training-free
        fashion since the contents of the datastore can be readily replaced. Our experiments
        show that SmallCap, trained only on COCO, has competitive performance on this
        benchmark, and also transfers to other domains without retraining, solely
        through retrieval from target-domain data. Further improvement is achieved

      abstract: Inspired by retrieval-augmented language generation and pretrained
        Vision and Language (V&L) encoders, we present a new approach to image captioning
        that generates sentences given the input image and a set of captions retrieved
        from a datastore, as opposed to the image alone. The encoder in our model
        jointly processes the image and retrieved captions using a pretrained V&L
        BERT, while the decoder attends to the multimodal encoder representations,
        benefiting from the extra textual evidence from the retrieved captions. Experimental
        results on the COCO dataset show that image captioning can be effectively
        formulated from this new perspective. Our model, named EXTRA, benefits from
        using captions retrieved from the training dataset, and it can also benefit
        from using an external dataset without the need for retraining. Ablation studies
        show that retrieving a sufficient number of captions (e.g., k=5) can improve
        captioning quality. Our work contributes towards using pretrained V&L encoders
        for generative tasks, instead of standard classification tasks.

        robots. Contrary to traditional industrial robots, collaborative robots are

        (PV) modules is mainly based on electrical measurements and performance evaluation.
        However, such practices exhibit restricted fault-detection ability. This study
        proposes the use of standard thermal image processing and the Canny edge detection
        operator as diagnostic tools for module-related faults that lead to hot-spot
        heating effects. The intended techniques were applied on thermal images of

        conducted during this study. The whole approach provided promising results
        with the detection of hot-spot formations that were diagnosed to specific
        defective cells in each inspected module. These evolving hot spots lead to
        abnormally low performance of the PV modules, a fact that is also validated
        by the manufacturer's standard electrical tests.

      abstract: A typical robot assembly operation involves contacts with the parts
        of the product to be assembled and consequently requires the knowledge of
        not only position and orientation trajectories but also the accompanying force-torque
        profiles for successful performance. To learn the execution of assembly operations
        even when the geometry of the product varies across task executions, the robot
        needs to be able to adapt its motion based on a parametric description of
        the current task condition, which is usually provided by geometrical properties
        of the parts involved in the assembly. In our previous work we showed how
        positional control policies can be generalized to different task conditions.
        In this paper we propose a complete methodology to generalize also the orientational
        trajectories and the accompanying force-torque profiles to compute the necessary
        control policy for a given condition of the assembly task. Our …

      abstract: A food recipe is an ordered set of instructions for preparing a particular
        dish. From a visual perspective, every instruction step can be seen as a way
        to change the visual appearance of the dish by adding extra objects (eg, adding
        an ingredient) or changing the appearance of the existing ones (eg, cooking
        the dish). In this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by
        building a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure. To do
        so, we learn composable module operations which are able to either add or
        remove a particular ingredient. Each operator is designed as a Generative
        Adversarial Network (GAN). Given only weak image-level supervision, the operators
        are trained to generate a visual layer that needs to be added to or removed
        from the existing image. The proposed model is able to decompose an image
        into an ordered sequence of layers by applying sequentially in the right order
        the corresponding removing modules. Experimental results on synthetic and
        real pizza images demonstrate that our proposed model is able to:(1) segment
        pizza toppings in a weakly-supervised fashion,(2) remove them by revealing
        what is occluded underneath them (ie, inpainting), and (3) infer the ordering
        of the toppings without any depth ordering supervision. Code, data, and models
        are available online.

      abstract: Training an object class detector typically requires a large set of
        images annotated with bounding-boxes, which is expensive and time consuming
        to create. We propose novel approach to annotate object locations which can
        substantially reduce annotation time. We first track the eye movements of
        annotators instructed to find the object and then propose a technique for
        deriving object bounding-boxes from these fixations. To validate our idea,
        we collected eye tracking data for the trainval part of 10 object classes
        of Pascal VOC 2012 (6,270 images, 5 observers). Our technique correctly produces
        bounding-boxes in 50%of the images, while reducing the total annotation time

      abstract: In this paper, we are interested in modeling a how-to instructional
        procedure, such as a cooking recipe, with a meaningful and rich high-level
        representation. Specifically, we propose to represent cooking recipes and
        food images as cooking programs. Programs provide a structured representation
        of the task, capturing cooking semantics and sequential relationships of actions
        in the form of a graph. This allows them to be easily manipulated by users
        and executed by agents. To this end, we build a model that is trained to learn
        a joint embedding between recipes and food images via self-supervision and
        jointly generate a program from this embedding as a sequence. To validate
        our idea, we crowdsource programs for cooking recipes and show that:(a) projecting
        the image-recipe embeddings into programs leads to better cross-modal retrieval
        results;(b) generating programs from images leads to better recognition results
        compared to predicting raw cooking instructions; and (c) we can generate food
        images by manipulating programs via optimizing the latent code of a GAN. Code,

      abstract: Manually annotating object segmentation masks is very time-consuming.
        While interactive segmentation methods offer a more efficient alternative,
        they become unaffordable at a large scale because the cost grows linearly
        with the number of annotated masks. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient
        annotation scheme for building large datasets with object segmentation masks.
        At a large scale, images contain many object instances with similar appearance.
        We exploit these similarities by using hierarchical clustering on mask predictions
        made by a segmentation model. We propose a scheme that efficiently searches
        through the hierarchy of clusters and selects which clusters to annotate.
        Humans manually verify only a few masks per cluster, and the labels are propagated
        to the whole cluster. Through a large-scale experiment to populate 1M unlabeled
        images with object segmentation masks for 80 object classes, we show that
        (1) we obtain 1M object segmentation masks with an total annotation time of
        only 290 hours;(2) we reduce annotation time by 76x compared to manual annotation;(3)
        the segmentation quality of our masks is on par with those from manually annotated
        datasets. Code, data, and models are available online.

        computer vision datasets, and it is very time consuming (annotating ILSVRC
        [53] took 35s for one high-quality box [62]). It involves clicking on imaginary
        corners of a tight box around the object. This is difficult as these corners
        are often outside the actual object and several adjustments are required to
        obtain a tight box. We propose extreme clicking instead: we ask the annotator
        to click on four physical points on the object: the top, bottom, left-and
        right-most points. This task is more natural and these points are easy to
        find. We crowd-source extreme point annotations for PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012
        and show that (1) annotation time is only 7s per box, 5x faster than the traditional
        way of drawing boxes [62];(2) the quality of the boxes is as good as the original
        ground-truth drawn the traditional way;(3) detectors trained on our annotations
        are as accurate as those trained on the original ground-truth. Moreover, our
        extreme clicking strategy not only yields box coordinates, but also four accurate
        boundary points. We show (4) how to incorporate them into GrabCut to obtain
        more accurate segmentations than those delivered when initializing it from

        re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and
        human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training
        and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps
        different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive
        experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update
        detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality

      abstract: We address the problem of estimating image difficulty defined as the
        human response time for solving a visual search task. We collect human annotations
        of image difficulty for the PASCAL VOC 2012 data set through a crowd-sourcing
        platform. We then analyze what human interpretable image properties can have
        an impact on visual search difficulty, and how accurate are those properties
        for predicting difficulty. Next, we build a regression model based on deep
        features learned with state of the art convolutional neural networks and show
        better results for predicting the ground-truth visual search difficulty scores
        produced by human annotators. Our model is able to correctly rank about 75%
        image pairs according to their difficulty score. We also show that our difficulty
        predictor generalizes well to new classes not seen during training. Finally,
        we demonstrate that our predicted difficulty scores are useful for weakly
        supervised object localization (8% improvement) and semi-supervised object
        classification (1% improvement).

      abstract: Responding to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, and
        wildfires, is a laborious task performed by on-the-ground emergency responders
        and analysts. Social media has emerged as a low-latency data source to quickly
        understand disaster situations. While most studies on social media are limited
        to text, images offer more information for understanding disaster and incident
        scenes. However, no large-scale image datasets for incident detection exists.
        In this work, we present the Incidents Dataset, which contains 446,684 images
        annotated by humans that cover 43 incidents across a variety of scenes. We
        employ a baseline classification model that mitigates false-positive errors
        and we perform image filtering experiments on millions of social media images
        from Flickr and Twitter. Through these experiments, we show how the Incidents
        Dataset can be used to detect images with incidents in the wild …

      abstract: BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains and amphipathic α‐helices (AHs)
        are believed to be sensors of membrane curvature thus facilitating the assembly
        of protein complexes on curved membranes. Here, we used quantitative fluorescence
        microscopy to compare the binding of both motifs on single nanosized liposomes
        of different diameters and therefore membrane curvature. Characterization
        of members of the three BAR domain families showed surprisingly that the crescent‐shaped
        BAR dimer with its positively charged concave face is not able to sense membrane
        curvature. Mutagenesis on BAR domains showed that membrane curvature sensing
        critically depends on the N‐terminal AH and furthermore that BAR domains sense
        membrane curvature through hydrophobic insertion in lipid packing defects
        and not through electrostatics. Consequently, amphipathic motifs, such as
        AHs, that are often associated with …

      abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate many critical physiological
        processes. Their spatial organization in plasma membrane (PM) domains is believed
        to encode signaling specificity and efficiency. However, the existence of
        domains and, crucially, the mechanism of formation of such putative domains
        remain elusive. Here, live-cell imaging (corrected for topography-induced
        imaging artifacts) conclusively established the existence of PM domains for
        GPCRs. Paradoxically, energetic coupling to extremely shallow PM curvature
        (<1 µm−1) emerged as the dominant, necessary and sufficient molecular mechanism
        of GPCR spatiotemporal organization. Experiments with different GPCRs, H-Ras,
        Piezo1 and epidermal growth factor receptor, suggest that the mechanism is
        general, yet protein specific, and can be regulated by ligands. These findings
        delineate a new spatiomechanical molecular mechanism that …

      abstract: In the course of cancer progression tumor cells undergo morphological
        changes that lead to increased motility and invasiveness thus promoting formation
        of metastases. This process called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
        is triggered by transforming growth factor (TGFβ) but for gaining the full
        invasive potential an interplay between signaling of TGFβ and Ras GTPases
        is required. Ras proteins possess a lipidated domain that mediates Ras association
        with the plasma membrane, which is essential for Ras biological functions.
        Type and number of the lipid anchors are the main difference among three Ras
        variants—H-ras, N-ras and K-ras. The lipid anchors determine membrane partitioning
        of lipidated proteins into membrane areas of specific physico-chemical properties
        and curvature. In this study, we investigated the effect of TGFβ treatment

      abstract: Synucleins and apolipoproteins have been implicated in a number of
        membrane and lipid trafficking events. Lipid interaction for both types of
        proteins is mediated by 11 amino acid repeats that form amphipathic helices.
        This similarity suggests that synucleins and apolipoproteins might have comparable
        effects on lipid membranes, but this has not been shown directly. Here, we
        find that α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and apolipoprotein A-1 have the conserved
        functional ability to induce membrane curvature and to convert large vesicles
        into highly curved membrane tubules and vesicles. The resulting structures
        are morphologically similar to those generated by amphiphysin, a curvature-inducing
        protein involved in endocytosis. Unlike amphiphysin, however, synucleins and
        apolipoproteins do not require any scaffolding domains and curvature induction
        is mediated by the membrane insertion and wedging of amphipathic …

      abstract: Vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatases (V-ATPases) are electrogenic
        rotary mechanoenzymes structurally related to F-type ATP synthases. They hydrolyze
        ATP to establish electrochemical proton gradients for a plethora of cellular
        processes. In neurons, the loading of all neurotransmitters into synaptic
        vesicles is energized by~ 1 V-ATPase molecule per synaptic vesicle. To shed
        light into this bona fide single-molecule biological process, we investigated
        electrogenic proton pumping by single mammalian-brain V-ATPases, using individual
        synaptic vesicles fused with immobilized liposomes. We show V-ATPases do not
        pump continuously in time, as hypothesized by observing the rotation of bacterial
        homologs and assuming strict ATP/proton coupling. Instead, they stochastically
        switch between three novel ultra-long-lived proton-pumping, inactive, and
        proton-leaky modes. Upending conventional wisdom, direct observation of pumping
        revealed that physiologically relevant concentrations of ATP do not regulate
        the intrinsic pumping rate. Instead, ATP regulates V-ATPase activity via the
        switching probability of the proton-pumping mode. In contrast, electrochemical
        proton gradients regulate the pumping rate and the switching of the pumping
        and inactive modes. This work reveals and emphasises the mechanistic and biological
        importance of mode-switching in protein regulation.

        turning cellular membranes into workshops where virus and host factors come
        together to make new virus particles. We investigated how M structure and
        organization is related to virus shape and size using cryo-electron microscopy,

        adopt two conformations and that membrane curvature is regulated by one M

      abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the β- herpesviruses and is ubiquitous,

        reactivation of CMV is usually asymptomatic, but reactivation events in immunocompromised
        or immunosuppressed individuals can lead to severe morbidity and mortality.
        Moreover, herpesvirus infections have been associated with several cardiovascular

      abstract: It is often enough to localize environmental sources of noise from
        different directions in a plane. This can be accomplished with a circular
        microphone array, which can be designed to have practically the same resolution
        over 360. The microphones can be suspended in free space or they can be mounted
        on a solid cylinder. This investigation examines and compares two techniques
        based on such arrays, the classical delay-and-sum beamforming and an alternative
        method called circular harmonics beamforming. The latter is based on decomposing
        the sound field into a series of circular harmonics. The performance of the
        two signal processing techniques is examined using computer simulations, and
        the results are validated experimentally.

        a method to reconstruct the response at arbitrary points based on compressive

        their amplitudes are estimated via CS, obtaining a spatially sparse representation

      abstract: The reconstruction of sound fields in a room from a limited set of
        measurements is a central problem in acoustics, with relevant applications
        in e.g. acoustic analysis, audio, or sound field control. Conventional approaches
        rely on measuring the room impulse response (RIR) at several locations in
        the room, and fitting a wave model that enables to estimate the field at other
        locations – via solving an inverse problem. Previous studies have shown that
        the reconstruction of RIRs strongly depends on the physical model and the
        regularization method used to solve the problem, and that enforcing sparsity
        is beneficial for the reconstruction of the early part of the RIR. This work
        studies Bayesian regression with time-dependent regularization in order to
        exploit the temporal properties of RIRs for a better reconstruction. The inverse
        problem is solved in the time domain, where hierarchical Bayes is applied

      abstract: Near-field acoustic holography (NAH) is a very powerful and widely
        used technique for the study of complex acoustic radiators. NAH enables to
        quickly understand how a complex source radiates into the medium. The technique
        is particularly suitable at low frequencies. At high frequencies, a dense
        transducer interspacing is required, and the measurement microphones can disturb
        the studied sound field when their size is comparable to the acoustic wavelength.
        In this study we examine the use of acousto-optic sensing in NAH. Acousto-optic
        sensing uses light beams as the sensing element, making it possible to acquire
        remote and non-invasive measurements without introducing extraneous objects

        reconstructing sound fields from experimental data. It is investigated whether
        generative models, which learn the underlying statistics of a given signal
        or process, can improve the spatio-temporal reconstruction of a sound field
        by extending its bandwidth. The problem is significant as acoustic array processing
        is naturally band limited by the spatial sampling of the sound field (due
        to the difficulty to satisfy the Nyquist criterion in space domain at high
        frequencies). In this study, the reconstruction of spatial room impulse responses
        in a conventional room is tested based on three different generative adversarial
        models. The results indicate that the models can improve the reconstruction,

        lost at high frequencies. There is an encouraging outlook in the use of statistical

        of a sparse formulation of the equivalent source method, based on the compressive
        sensing (CS) framework. The method, denoted Compressive–Equivalent Source
        Method (C-ESM), encourages spatially sparse solutions (based on the superposition
        of few waves) that are accurate when the acoustic sources are spatially localized.
        The importance of obtaining a non-redundant representation, ie, a sensing
        matrix with low column coherence, and the inherent ill-conditioning of near-field
        reconstruction problems is addressed. Numerical and experimental results on
        a classical guitar and on a highly reactive dipole-like source are presented.
        C-ESM is valid beyond the conventional sampling limits, making wide-band reconstruction
        possible. Spatially extended sources can also be addressed with C-ESM, although
        in this case the obtained solution …

      abstract: Kevlar-walled aeroacoustic wind tunnels have become important research
        facilities to evaluate low-noise wind turbine designs. In this paper a semi-analytical
        Green’s function for the transmission of sound through Kevlar walls and shear
        layers was developed in order to provide accurate acoustic measurements at
        high flow speeds. The semi-analytical Green’s function was evaluated experimentally
        with a monopole sound source. It was possible to find the correct source location
        when the Green’s function was used to formulate the steering vectors for the
        beamforming technique. The corrected steering vectors provided a much better
        source level estimation than if a free-field Green’s function was used to
        formulated the steering vectors, but there was a systematic overcorrection
        at low frequencies and an undercorrection at high frequencies. The analytical
        transmission loss was very sensitive to the convection velocity …

      abstract: In conventional near-field acoustic holography (NAH) it is not possible
        to distinguish between sound from the two sides of the array, thus, it is
        a requirement that all the sources are confined to only one side and radiate
        into a free field. When this requirement cannot be fulfilled, sound field
        separation techniques make it possible to distinguish between outgoing and
        incoming waves from the two sides, and thus NAH can be applied. In this paper,
        a separation method based on the measurement of the particle velocity in two
        layers and another method based on the measurement of the pressure and the
        velocity in a single layer are proposed. The two methods use an equivalent
        source formulation with separate transfer matrices for the outgoing and incoming
        waves, so that the sound from the two sides of the array can be modeled independently.
        A weighting scheme is proposed to account for the distance between the …

      abstract: Medical imaging models have been shown to encode information about
        patient demographics (age, race, sex) in their latent representation, raising
        concerns about their potential for discrimination. Here, we ask whether it
        is feasible and desirable to train models that do not encode demographic attributes.
        We consider different types of invariance with respect to demographic attributes
        - marginal, class-conditional, and counterfactual model invariance - and lay
        out their equivalence to standard notions of algorithmic fairness. Drawing
        on existing theory, we find that marginal and class-conditional invariance
        can be considered overly restrictive approaches for achieving certain fairness
        notions, resulting in significant predictive performance losses. Concerning
        counterfactual model invariance, we note that defining medical image counterfactuals
        with respect to demographic attributes is fraught with complexities. Finally,
        we posit that demographic encoding may even be considered advantageous if
        it enables learning a task-specific encoding of demographic features that
        does not rely on human-constructed categories such as 'race' and 'gender'.
        We conclude that medical imaging models may need to encode demographic attributes,
        lending further urgency to calls for comprehensive model fairness assessments
        in terms of predictive performance.

      abstract: While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in
        the medical field, the causes of differences in prediction performance are
        often unknown. This lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the
        efficacy of bias mitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset
        balancing still often performs best in reducing performance gaps but is unable
        to resolve all performance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes
        of gender bias in machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis. In particular,
        we explore the hypothesis that breast tissue leads to underexposure of the
        lungs and causes lower model performance. Methodologically, we propose a new
        sampling method which addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings
        per patient in two widely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing
        the impact of label errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences
        across diseases, datasets, and gender representations in the training set
        shows that dataset imbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences.
        Moreover, relative group performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating
        important dataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance.
        Finally, we investigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by
        cropping out the breasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve
        the observed performance gaps. In conclusion, our results indicate that dataset-specific
        factors, not fundamental physiological differences, are the main drivers of
        male--female performance gaps in chest X-ray analyses on widely used NIH and
        CheXpert Dataset.

      abstract: Neuromuscular physiology is a vibrant research field that has recently
        seen exciting advances. Previous publications have focused on thorough analyses
        of particular aspects of neuromuscular physiology, yet an integration of the
        various novel findings into a single, comprehensive model is missing. In this
        article, we provide a unified description of a comprehensive mathematical
        model of surface electromyographic (EMG) measurements and the corresponding
        force signal in skeletal muscles, both consolidating and extending the results
        of previous studies regarding various components of the neuromuscular system.
        The model comprises motor unit (MU) pool organization, recruitment and rate
        coding, intracellular action potential generation and the resulting EMG measurements,
        as well as the generated muscular force during voluntary isometric contractions.
        Mathematically, it consists of a large number of linear PDEs, ODEs, and various
        stochastic nonlinear relationships, some of which are solved analytically,
        others numerically. A parameterization of the electrical and mechanical components
        of the model is proposed that ensures a physiologically meaningful EMG-force
        relation in the simulated signals, in particular taking the continuous, size-dependent
        distribution of MU parameters into account. Moreover, a novel nonlinear transformation
        of the common drive model input is proposed, which ensures that the model
        force output equals the desired target force. On a physiological level, this
        corresponds to adjusting the rate coding model to the force generating capabilities
        of the simulated muscle, while from a control theoretic point of view, this

      abstract: Electromyographic (EMG) measurements of the respiratory muscles provide
        a convenient and noninvasive way to assess respiratory muscle function and
        detect patient activity during assisted mechanical ventilation. However, surface

        of discrete decisions, or classifications. While such decisions are often
        based on risk score models, the fairness of the risk models themselves has
        received considerably less attention. Risk models are of interest for a number

        potential outcomes to users, thus representing a way to enable meaningful
        human oversight. Here, we address fairness desiderata for risk score models.
        We identify the provision of similar epistemic value to different groups as
        a key desideratum for risk score fairness, and we show how even fair risk
        scores can lead to unfair risk-based rankings. Further, we address how to

      abstract: To ensure equitable quality of care, differences in machine learning
        model performance between patient groups must be addressed. Here, we argue
        that two separate mechanisms can cause performance differences between groups.
        First, model performance may be worse than theoretically achievable in a given
        group. This can occur due to a combination of group underrepresentation, modeling
        choices, and the characteristics of the prediction task at hand. We examine
        scenarios in which underrepresentation leads to underperformance, scenarios
        in which it does not, and the differences between them. Second, the optimal
        achievable performance may also differ between groups due to differences in
        the intrinsic difficulty of the prediction task. We discuss several possible
        causes of such differences in task difficulty. In addition, challenges such
        as label biases and selection biases may confound both learning and …

        in biological organisms. The growth process is guided by another neural network,

        an approach to control these type of systems called Goal-Guided Neural Cellular
        Automata (GoalNCA), which leverages goal encodings to control cell behavior
        dynamically at every step of cellular growth. This approach enables the NCA
        to continually change behavior, and in some cases, generalize its behavior
        to unseen scenarios. We also demonstrate the robustness of the NCA with its
        ability to preserve task performance, even when only a portion of cells receive

        synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role in this process. Inspired by this
        biological mechanism, we propose a search method that, instead of optimizing
        the weight parameters of neural networks directly, only searches for synapse-specific
        Hebbian learning rules that allow the network to continuously self-organize
        its weights during the lifetime of the agent. We demonstrate our approach
        on several reinforcement learning tasks with different sensory modalities
        and more than 450K trainable plasticity parameters. We find that starting
        from completely random weights, the discovered Hebbian rules enable an agent
        to navigate a dynamical 2D-pixel environment; likewise they allow a simulated
        3D quadrupedal robot to learn how to walk while adapting to morphological
        damage not seen during training and in the absence of any explicit reward
        or error signal in less than 100 timesteps.

      abstract: Distinguishing animate from inanimate things is of great behavioural
        importance. Despite distinct brain and behavioural responses to animate and
        inanimate things, it remains unclear which object properties drive these responses.
        Here, we investigate the importance of five object dimensions related to animacy
        (“being alive”, “looking like an animal”, “having agency”, “having mobility”,
        and “being unpredictable”) in brain (fMRI, EEG) and behaviour (property and
        similarity judgements) of 19 participants. We used a stimulus set of 128 images,
        optimized by a genetic algorithm to disentangle these five dimensions. The
        five dimensions explained much variance in the similarity judgments. Each
        dimension explained significant variance in the brain representations (except,
        surprisingly, “being alive”), however, to a lesser extent than in behaviour.
        Different brain regions sensitive to animacy may represent distinct dimensions

      abstract: Segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images is often based
        on a voxel/pixel classification approach. Deep learning systems, such as convolutional
        neural networks (CNNs), can infer a hierarchical representation of images
        that fosters categorization. We propose a novel system for voxel classification
        integrating three 2D CNNs, which have a one-to-one association with the xy,
        yz and zx planes of 3D image, respectively. We applied our method to the segmentation
        of tibial cartilage in low field knee MRI scans and tested it on 114 unseen
        scans. Although our method uses only 2D features at a single scale, it performs
        better than a state-of-the-art method using 3D multi-scale features. In the
        latter approach, the features and the classifier have been carefully adapted
        to the problem at hand. That we were able to get better results by a deep
        learning architecture that autonomously learns the features …

      abstract: The accelerated development of machine learning methods, primarily
        deep learning, are causal to the recent breakthroughs in medical image analysis
        and computer aided intervention. The resource consumption of deep learning
        models in terms of amount of training data, compute and energy costs are known
        to be massive. These large resource costs can be barriers in deploying these
        models in clinics, globally. To address this, there are cogent efforts within
        the machine learning community to introduce notions of resource efficiency.
        For instance, using quantisation to alleviate memory consumption. While most
        of these methods are shown to reduce the resource utilisation, they could
        come at a cost in performance. In this work, we probe into the trade-off between
        resource consumption and performance, specifically, when dealing with models
        that are used in critical settings such as in clinics.

      abstract: 'Many approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of finding
        the optic flow field of an image sequence. Three major classes of optic flow
        computation techniques can discriminated (see for a good overview Beauchemin
        and Barron IBeauchemin19951): gradient based (or differential) methods; phase
        based (or frequency domain) methods; correlation based (or area) methods;
        feature point (or sparse data) tracking methods; In this chapter we compute
        the optic flow as a dense optic flow field with a multi scale differential
        method. The method, originally proposed by Florack and Nielsen [Florack1998a]
        is known as the Multiscale Optic Flow Constrain Equation (MOFCE). This is
        a scale space version of the well known computer vision implementation of
        the optic flow constraint equation, as originally proposed by Horn and Schunck
        [Horn1981]. This scale space variation, as usual, consists of the introduction
        of the aperture of the observation in the process. The application to stereo
        has been described by Maas et al.[Maas 1995a, Maas 1996a]. Of course, difficulties
        arise when structure emerges or disappears, such as with occlusion, cloud
        formation etc. Then knowledge is needed about the processes and objects involved.

        winter wheat genotypes were phenotyped for root growth in 2018/2019, respectively.
        Using the minirhizotron technique, root images were acquired across a depth
        range from 80 to 250 cm in May, June, and July and pRLD was extracted using
        a convolutional neural network. We developed ML models to explore whether
        the pRLD estimates at different soil depths were predictive of the uptake
        of deep soil nitrogen-using deep placement of 15N tracer as well as drought
        resilience potential using natural abundance of 13C isotope. We analyzed the
        correlations to tracer levels to both an analytical root depth estimation
        and an ML approach. We further analyzed the genotypic effects on root function
        using mediation analysis.ResultsBoth analytical and ML models demonstrated
        clear correlations between pRLD distribution and resource uptake. Further,
        both models demonstrated that deep roots at approx. 150 to 170 cm depth were
        most important for explaining the plant content of 15N and 13C isotopes. The
        correlations were higher in 2018 than in 2019.ConclusionsThe results demonstrated
        that in the semi-field non-invasive root phenotyping setup, analytical and
        ML-based analysis provided complementary insight into the importance of deep
        rooting for water and nitrogen uptake.

        properties, and how they can be used to rotate objects. We introduce quaternion
        mathematics and discuss why quaternions are a better choice for implementing
        rotation than the well-known matrix implementations. We then treat di erent
        methods for interpolation between series of rotations. During this treatment
        we give complete proofs for the correctness of the important interpolation
        methods Slerp and Squad. Inspired by our treatment of the di erent interpolation
        methods we develop our own interpolation method called Spring based on a set
        of objective constraints for an optimal interpolation curve. This results
        in a set of di erential equations, whose analytical solution meets these constraints.
        Unfortunately, the set of di erential equations cannot be solved analytically.
        As an alternative we propose a numerical solution for the di erential equations.
        The di erent interpolation methods are visualized and commented. Finally we
        provide a thorough comparison of the two most convincing methods (Spring and
        Squad). Thereby, this report provides a comprehensive treatment of quaternions,
        rotation with quaternions, and interpolation curves for series of rotations.

      abstract: Semantic segmentation of biomedical images found its niche in screening
        and diagnostic applications. Recent methods based on deep learning convolutional
        neural networks have been very effective, since they are readily adaptive
        to biomedical applications and outperform other competitive segmentation methods.
        Inspired by the U-Net, we designed a deep learning network with an innovative
        architecture, hereafter referred to as AID-U-Net. Our network consists of
        direct contracting and expansive paths, as well as a distinguishing feature
        of containing sub-contracting and sub-expansive paths. The implementation
        results on seven totally different databases of medical images demonstrated
        that our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions with
        no specific pre-trained backbones for both 2D and 3D biomedical image segmentation
        tasks. Furthermore, we showed that AID-U-Net dramatically reduces time inference
        and computational complexity in terms of the number of learnable parameters.
        The results further show that the proposed AID-U-Net can segment different
        medical objects, achieving an improved 2D F1-score and 3D mean BF-score of
        3.82% and 2.99%, respectively.

        from numerous sources and modalities using questionnaires, physical signals,
        and physiological signals. Recently, motion recognition has gained attention
        because of its diverse application areas, like affective computing, healthcare,
        human–robot interactions, and market research. This paper provides a comprehensive
        and systematic review of emotion recognition techniques of the current decade.
        The paper includes emotion recognition using physical and physiological signals.
        Physical signals involve speech and facial expression, while physiological
        signals include electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response,
        and eye tracking. The paper provides an introduction to various emotion models,
        stimuli used for emotion elicitation, and the background of existing automated
        emotion recognition systems. This paper covers …

      abstract: Animal welfare is an issue of great importance in modern food production
        systems. Because animal behavior provides reliable information about animal
        health and welfare, recent research has aimed at designing monitoring systems
        capable of measuring behavioral parameters and transforming them into their
        corresponding behavioral modes. However, network unreliability and high-energy
        consumption have limited the applicability of those systems. In this study,
        a 2.4-GHz ZigBee-based mobile ad hoc wireless sensor network (MANET) that
        is able to overcome those problems is presented. The designed MANET showed
        high communication reliability, low energy consumption and low packet loss
        rate (14.8%) due to the deployment of modern communication protocols (e.g.
        multi-hop communication and handshaking protocol). The measured behavioral
        parameters were transformed into the corresponding …

      abstract: Site‐specific weed control technologies are defined as machinery or
        equipment embedded with technologies that detect weeds growing in a crop and,
        taking into account predefined factors such as economics, take action to maximise
        the chances of successfully controlling them. In this study, we describe the
        basic parts of site‐specific weed control technologies, comprising weed sensing
        systems, weed management models and precision weed control implements. A review
        of state‐of‐the‐art technologies shows that several weed sensing systems and
        precision implements have been developed over the last two decades, although
        barriers prevent their breakthrough. Most important among these is the lack
        of a truly robust weed recognition method, owing to mutual shading among plants
        and limitations in the capacity of highly accurate spraying and weeding apparatus.
        Another barrier is the lack of …

      abstract: The problem of online monitoring of cows’ presence and pasture time
        in an extended area covered by a strip of new grass using wireless sensor
        networks has been addressed. The total pasture time in the extended area was
        estimated by measuring the pasture time in a specific part of that area called
        the gateway connectivity area where sensor nodes mounted on the cows could
        communicate directly with a gateway. Packet loss causes a node that was present
        in the connectivity range of the gateway frequently to be classified as an
        absent node. Therefore, a moving average window with optimal window length
        and threshold was designed to minimize the misclassification. As the measured
        pasture time in the gateway connectivity area was an underestimation of the
        total pasture time in the extended area, an area-based correction factor,
        same for all individual animals was applied. As only 23% of the animals in

      abstract: The current study of human-machine alignment aims at understanding
        the geometry of latent spaces and the correspondence to human representations.
        G\"ardenfors' conceptual spaces is a prominent framework for understanding
        human representations. Convexity of object regions in conceptual spaces is
        argued to promote generalizability, few-shot learning, and intersubject alignment.
        Based on these insights, we investigate the notion of convexity of concept
        regions in machine-learned latent spaces. We develop a set of tools for measuring
        convexity in sampled data and evaluate emergent convexity in layered representations
        of state-of-the-art deep networks. We show that convexity is robust to basic
        re-parametrization, hence, meaningful as a quality of machine-learned latent
        spaces. We find that approximate convexity is pervasive in neural representations
        in multiple application domains, including models of images, audio, human
        activity, text, and brain data. We measure convexity separately for labels
        (i.e., targets for fine-tuning) and other concepts. Generally, we observe
        that fine-tuning increases the convexity of label regions, while for more
        general concepts, it depends on the alignment of the concept with the fine-tuning
        objective. We find evidence that pre-training convexity of class label regions
        predicts subsequent fine-tuning performance.

        We deploy heuristic algorithms and exhaustive ones to generate Bayesian networks

      abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) have shown great promise in overcoming
        the speed and efficiency bottlenecks of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
        However, the absence of high-speed, energy-efficient nonlinear activators
        significantly impedes the advancement of ONNs and their extension to ultrafast
        application scenarios like autonomous vehicles and real-time intelligent signal
        processing. In this work, we designed and fabricated a novel silicon-based
        ultrafast all-optical nonlinear activator, leveraging the hybrid integration
        of silicon slot waveguides, plasmonic slot waveguides, and monolayer graphene.
        We utilized double-balanced detection and synchronous pump-probe measurement
        techniques to experimentally evaluate the static and dynamic characteristics
        of the activators, respectively. Exploiting the exceptional picosecond scale
        photogenerated carrier relaxation time of graphene, the response time of the
        activator is markedly reduced to~ 93.6 ps. This response time is approximately
        five times faster than electronic neural networks, establishing our all-optical
        activator as the fastest known in silicon photonics to our knowledge. Moreover,
        the all-optical nonlinear activator holds a low threshold power of 5.49 mW
        and a corresponding power consumption per activation of 0.51 pJ. Furthermore,
        we confirm its feasibility and capability for use in ONNs by simulation, achieving
        a high accuracy of 96.8% for MNIST handwritten digit recognition and a mean
        absolute error of less than 0.1 dB for optical signal-to-noise ratio monitoring

        in Internet traffic. In a few years, the current fiber optic communication
        system infrastructure will not be able to meet this demand because fiber nonlinearity
        dramatically limits the information transmission rate. Eigenvalue communication
        could potentially overcome these limitations. It relies on a mathematical
        technique called “nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT)” to exploit the “hidden”
        linearity of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation as the master model for signal
        propagation in an optical fiber. We present here the theoretical tools describing

      abstract: The paper focuses on the security of fiber-optic cable infrastructures
        by detecting vibrations using an optical state of polarization analyzer. The
        developed system can detect various security breaches. The system only detects
        abnormal events without any event classification. The proposed system relies
        on an analyzer evaluating optical polarization differences caused by mechanical
        or acoustic vibrations analyzed by a machine-learning model for real-time
        anomaly detection. The main goal of experiments is to find the best combination
        of the normalization method and anomaly detector. The proposed system achieves
        an F1-score over 95.65%, which proves the solution’s suitability for protecting
        fiber-optic infrastructures.

      abstract: Low-complexity neural networks (NNs) have successfully been applied
        for digital signal processing (DSP) in short-reach intensity-modulated directly
        detected optical links, where chromatic dispersion-induced impairments significantly
        limit the transmission distance. The NN-based equalizers are usually optimized
        independently from other DSP components, such as matched filtering. This approach
        may result in lower equalization performance. Alternatively, optimizing a
        NN equalizer to perform functionalities of multiple DSP blocks may increase
        transmission reach while keeping the complexity low. In this work, we propose
        a low-complexity NN that performs samples-to-symbol equalization, meaning
        that the NN-based equalizer includes match filtering and downsampling. We
        compare it to a samples-to-sample equalization approach followed by match
        filtering and downsampling in terms of performance and computational complexity.
        Both approaches are evaluated using three different types of NNs combined
        with optical preprocessing. We numerically and experimentally show that the
        proposed samples-to-symbol equalization approach applied for 32 GBd on-off
        keying (OOK) signals outperforms the samples-domain alternative keeping the
        computational complexity low. Additionally, the different types of NN-based

      abstract: 'Most existing geometry processing algorithms use meshes as the default
        shape representation. Manipulating meshes, however, requires one to maintain
        high quality in the surface discretization. For example, changing the topology
        of a mesh usually requires additional procedures such as remeshing. This paper
        instead proposes the use of neural fields for geometry processing. Neural
        fields can compactly store complicated shapes without spatial discretization.
        Moreover, neural fields are infinitely differentiable, which allows them to
        be optimized for objectives that involve higher-order derivatives. This raises
        the question: can geometry processing be done entirely using neural fields?
        We introduce loss functions and architectures to show that some of the most

        Point cloud generation thus amounts to moving randomly sampled points to high-density
        areas. We generate point clouds by performing stochastic gradient ascent on
        an unnormalized probability density, thereby moving sampled points toward
        the high-likelihood regions. Our model directly predicts the gradient of the

        representation for objects and scenes derived from 2D data. Generating NeRFs,

      abstract: Evaluation metrics for image captioning face two challenges. Firstly,
        commonly used metrics such as CIDEr, METEOR, ROUGE and BLEU often do not correlate
        well with human judgments. Secondly, each metric has well known blind spots
        to pathological caption constructions, and rule-based metrics lack provisions
        to repair such blind spots once identified. For example, the newly proposed
        SPICE correlates well with human judgments, but fails to capture the syntactic
        structure of a sentence. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel
        learning based discriminative evaluation metric that is directly trained to
        distinguish between human and machine-generated captions. In addition, we
        further propose a data augmentation scheme to explicitly incorporate pathological
        transformations as negative examples during training. The proposed metric
        is evaluated with three kinds of robustness tests and its correlation with
        human judgments. Extensive experiments show that the proposed data augmentation
        scheme not only makes our metric more robust toward several pathological transformations,
        but also improves its correlation with human judgments. Our metric outperforms
        other metrics on both caption level human correlation in Flickr 8k and system
        level human correlation in COCO. The proposed approach could be served as
        a learning based evaluation metric that is complementary to existing rule-based
        metrics.

      abstract: As 3D point clouds become the representation of choice for multiple
        vision and graphics applications, the ability to synthesize or reconstruct
        high-resolution, high-fidelity point clouds becomes crucial. Despite the recent
        success of deep learning models in discriminative tasks of point clouds, generating
        point clouds remains challenging. This paper proposes a principled probabilistic
        framework to generate 3D point clouds by modeling them as a distribution of
        distributions. Specifically, we learn a two-level hierarchy of distributions
        where the first level is the distribution of shapes and the second level is
        the distribution of points given a shape. This formulation allows us to both
        sample shapes and sample an arbitrary number of points from a shape. Our generative
        model, named PointFlow, learns each level of the distribution with a continuous
        normalizing flow. The invertibility of normalizing flows enables the computation
        of the likelihood during training and allows us to train our model in the
        variational inference framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that PointFlow
        achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation. We additionally
        show that our model can faithfully reconstruct point clouds and learn useful
        representations in an unsupervised manner. The code is available at https://github.

      abstract: In applications such as optical see-through and projector augmented
        reality, producing images amounts to solving non-negative image generation,
        where one can only add light to an existing image. Most image generation methods,
        however, are ill-suited to this problem setting, as they make the assumption
        that one can assign arbitrary color to each pixel. In fact, naive application
        of existing methods fails even in simple domains such as MNIST digits, since
        one cannot create darker pixels by adding light. We know, however, that the
        human visual system can be fooled by optical illusions involving certain spatial
        configurations of brightness and contrast. Our key insight is that one can
        leverage this behavior to produce high quality images with negligible artifacts.
        For example, we can create the illusion of darker patches by brightening surrounding
        pixels. We propose a novel optimization procedure to produce images that satisfy
        both semantic and non-negativity constraints. Our approach can incorporate
        existing state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits strong performance in a variety
        of tasks including image-to-image translation and style transfer.

      abstract: Neural fields have emerged as a new paradigm for representing signals,
        thanks to their ability to do it compactly while being easy to optimize. In
        most applications, however, neural fields are treated like a black box, which
        precludes many signal manipulation tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
        class of neural fields called basis-encoded polynomial neural fields (PNFs).
        The key advantage of a PNF is that it can represent a signal as a composition
        of a number of manipulable and interpretable components without losing the
        merits of neural fields representation. We develop a general theoretical framework
        to analyze and design PNFs. We use this framework to design Fourier PNFs,
        which match state-of-the-art performance in signal representation tasks that
        use neural fields. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that Fourier PNFs
        enable signal manipulation applications such as texture transfer and scale-space
        interpolation. Code is available at https://github. com/stevenygd/PNF.

      abstract: 'It is expensive to label images with 3D structure or precise camera
        pose. Yet, this is precisely the kind of annotation required to train single-view
        3D reconstruction models. In contrast, unlabeled images or images with just
        category labels are easy to acquire, but few current models can use this weak
        supervision. We present a unified framework that can combine both types of
        supervision: a small amount of camera pose annotations are used to enforce
        pose-invariance and view-point consistency, and unlabeled images combined
        with an adversarial loss are used to enforce the realism of rendered, generated
        models. We use this unified framework to measure the impact of each form of
        supervision in three paradigms: semi-supervised, multi-task, and transfer
        learning. We show that with a combination of these ideas, we can train single-view
        reconstruction models that improve up to 7 points in performance (AP) when
        using only 1% pose annotated training data.'

      abstract: Although education is a fundamental human right for global citizens,
        educational inequality still exists within and among countries. Still today,
        many students struggle to access and receive quality education. Therefore,
        the value of using immersive technology to increase social competence and
        perceived social support for children who live in remote areas of the world,
        reduce inequality, and improve the quality of education requires much attention
        to address the lacuna between urban and rural education systems. Based on
        three representative pedagogies (Pedagogy of Technology, Play-based Learning,
        and Traditional Pedagogy), we designed three social competence educational
        approaches – virtual reality (VR) assisted social competence education, Lego
        social competence education, and traditional classroom learning – and applied
        them to interventions in two rural schools in Southwest China. Our results

      abstract: There has been a surge in interest and implementation of immersive
        virtual reality (IVR)-based lessons in education and training recently, which
        has resulted in many studies on the topic. There are recent reviews which
        summarize this research, but little work has been done that synthesizes the
        existing findings into a theoretical framework. The Cognitive Affective Model
        of Immersive Learning (CAMIL) synthesizes existing immersive educational research
        to describe the process of learning in IVR. The general theoretical framework
        of the model suggests that instructional methods which are based on evidence
        from research with less immersive media generalize to learning in IVR. However,
        the CAMIL builds on evidence that media interacts with method. That is, certain
        methods which facilitate the affordances of IVR are specifically relevant
        in this medium. The CAMIL identifies presence and agency as the …

        drastically increased. Developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic and new
        IT platforms like the metaverse have spurred a host of new immersive social
        applications that are accessed through head-mounted displays. This is expected
        to stimulate a surge in research on Extended Reality-supported Collaborative
        Learning (XRCL) which refers to distributed collaboration situations where
        immersive technology such as head-mounted displays are used as a medium for

        that occurs through traditional systems (eg, laptops): social presence, physical
        presence, body ownership, and agency. These are central factors that we hypothesize
        can transform the processes and contexts of collaboration through their influence
        on the quality of cognitive and socio-emotional social interaction, the social
        space, and ultimately learning outcomes. Since XRCL research is in its infancy,

      abstract: The overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to a significant rise
        in bacterial resistance, which has been recognized as a major threat to humanity
        by the World Health Organization (Organization and Others, 2019). Similarly
        to other societal challenges, eg, climate change, the consequences of antibiotic
        (ATB) resistance may be temporally or socially distant and very abstract.
        Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising tool for visualizing and communicating
        complex issues (Plechatá, Makransky, et al., 2022), such as antibiotic resistance.
        Previous research has shown that immersive VR experiences can effectively
        stimulate behavioral change by increasing efficacy beliefs (Ahn et al., 2014,
        2015; Plechatá, Morton, et al., 2022). This study aims to investigate whether
        an educational VR experience+ information game that emphasizes personal responsibility
        can more effectively promote responsible ATB use compared to receiving only
        information about ATB resistance in VR or in textual form.

      abstract: To reach necessary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, behavioral
        change is necessary at the consumer level. Nevertheless, behavioral interventions
        have only a limited impact on habitual behaviors such as beef consumption,
        which significantly contributes to the GHGs released. Immersive virtual reality
        (VR) in the metaverse can transform the current information-based environmental
        communication into more experience-based communication. To study how such
        a shift might change its effectiveness, we randomly assigned N= 167 participants
        to a VR experience (experiencing and influencing climate change based on food
        choices) or a VR information condition (receiving the same information from
        a virtual human). The VR experience led to higher intentions to reduce meat
        consumption and more pro-environmental behavior in VR and real life than the
        information condition. Mediation analyses confirm that experiential VR environmental
        communication can increase people’s efficacy beliefs, which increase their
        intentions and, consequently, lead to a reduction in beef consumption.

      abstract: Location privacy in mobile services has the potential to become a
        serious concern for service providers and users. Existing privacy protection
        techniques that use k-anonymity convert an original query into an anonymous
        query that contains the locations of multiple users. Such techniques, however,
        generally fail in offering guaranteed large privacy regions at reasonable
        query processing costs. In this paper, we propose the PAD approach that is
        capable of offering privacy-region guarantees. To achieve this, PAD uses so-called
        dummy locations that are deliberately generated according to either a virtual
        grid or circle. These cover a user's actual location, and their spatial extents
        are controlled by the generation algorithms. The PAD approach only requires

        an existing client/server mobile service system. In addition, query results

        A to B and uses the path to interpolate the vessel’s whereabouts in between.

      abstract: The literature on skyline algorithms has so far dealt mainly with
        queries of static query points over static data sets. With the increasing
        number of mobile service applications and users, however, the need for continuous
        skyline query processing has become more pressing. A continuous skyline query
        involves not only static dimensions, but also the dynamic one. In this paper,
        we examine the spatiotemporal coherence of the problem and propose a continuous
        skyline query processing strategy for moving query points. First, we distinguish
        the data points that are permanently in the skyline and use them to derive
        a search bound. Second, we investigate the connection between the spatial
        positions of data points and their dominance relationship, which provides
        an indication of where to find changes in the skyline and how to maintain
        the skyline continuously. Based on the analysis, we propose a kinetic-based

        certain labels are often located in close geographic proximity, are defined
        based on a support measure which quantifies the prevalence of a pattern candidate
        in the form of a label set. Existing support measures share the idea of counting
        the number of instances of a given label set C as its support, where an instance
        of C is an object set whose objects collectively carry all labels in C and
        are located close to one another. However, they suffer from various weaknesses,

        instances overlap. In this paper, we propose a new measure called Fraction-Score
        which counts instances fractionally if they overlap. Fraction-Score captures
        all possible instances, and handles the cases where instances overlap appropriately

      abstract: In a mobile service scenario, users query a server for nearby points
        of interest but they may not want to disclose their locations to the service.
        Intuitively, location privacy may be obtained at the cost of query performance
        and query accuracy. The challenge addressed is how to obtain the best possible
        performance, subjected to given requirements for location privacy and query
        accuracy. Existing privacy solutions that use spatial cloaking employ complex
        server query processing techniques and entail the transmission of large quantities

        multiple criteria. While most previous work has assumed a centralized setting
        this paper considers skyline querying in a mobile and distributed setting,
        where each mobile device is capable of holding only a portion of the whole

        a query issued by a mobile user is interested only in the user’s local area,

      abstract: The tracking of the locations of moving objects in large indoor spaces
        is important, as it enables a range of applications related to, e.g., security
        and indoor navigation and guidance. This paper presents a graph model based
        approach to indoor tracking that offers a uniform data management infrastructure
        for different symbolic positioning technologies, e.g., Bluetooth and RFID.
        More specifically, the paper proposes a model of indoor space that comprises
        a base graph and mappings that represent the topology of indoor space at different
        levels. The resulting model can be used for one or several indoor positioning
        technologies. Focusing on RFID-based positioning, an RFID specific reader

        potential in healthcare? Sustainability here is" the capacity to endure"(Lago

        technical dimensions. I aim to use the AI4XRAY project to investigate the
        many ways, we can transform AI from a concept that fires the imagination,
        to a tool or a method that has a real and enduring impact on the collaborative
        medical work. In order to achieve that, I frame my research with four questions
        that can be answered within the context and the timeline of the AI4XRAY project.
        The answers will provide a concrete contribution to the understanding of sustainable
        AI realisation in healthcare. The four research questions are:1. What are
        the challenges faced during real-world use of AI-based medical systems and
        how can we mitigate them? I posed this question at the beginning of my PhD
        after an initial literature analysis revealed no existing compilations of

        training datasets. Many researchers have pointed to the importance of the
        annotation step in the creation of high-quality data, but less attention has
        been paid to the work that enables data annotation. We define this work as
        the design of ground truth schema and explore the challenges involved in the
        creation of datasets in the medical domain even before any annotations are
        made. Based on extensive work in three health-tech organisations, we describe
        five external and internal factors that condition medical dataset creation
        processes. Three external factors include regulatory constraints, the context
        of creation and use, and commercial and operational pressures. These factors
        condition medical data collection and shape the ground truth schema design.
        Two internal factors include epistemic differences and limits of labelling.

        the amount of research on ML model development is growing, little is known

        of many ML-based systems. Design choices made before the labelling process
        often become invisible, and the ground truth becomes an infrastructural part
        of the data, which prevents it from being inspected in the event of problems
        at the later stages of the data science cycle. I conducted observations of
        the collaborative work of radiologists and data scientists on ground truth

        intelligence-based devices on human observers when diagnosing and/or detecting
        thoracic pathologies using different diagnostic imaging modalities, such as
        chest X-ray and CT. Peer-reviewed, original research articles from EMBASE,

        articles were published within the last 20 years and used a device based on
        artificial intelligence (AI) technology to detect or diagnose pulmonary findings.
        The AI-based device had to be used in an observer test where the performance
        of human observers with and without addition of the device was measured as
        sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC, or time spent on image reading. A
        total of 38 studies were included for final assessment. The quality assessment
        tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) was used for bias assessment.
        The average sensitivity increased from 67.8% to 74.6%; specificity from 82.2%
        to 85.4%; accuracy from 75.4% to 81.7%; and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

        moved their real body and arms significantly less, and subjective measures

        process models with a high level of flexibility by being able to describe
        the constraints that compliant traces must abide by. In this way, a well-formed
        declarative specification generates a family of compliant traces. However,
        little is known about the difference between different compliant traces, as
        the only criterion used for comparison is satisfiability. In particular, we
        believe that not all compliant traces are alike: some might be sub-optimal
        in their resource usage. In this work, we would like to support users of DPMs
        in the selection of compliant and optimal traces. In particular, we use Dynamic
        Condition Response (DCR) graphs as our language to represent DPMs, extending
        it with a parametric definition of costs linked to events. Multiple types
        of cost imply that different traces might be optimal, each according to a
        different cost dimension. We encode costeffective finite trace generation

        reasoning. Specifically, we investigate if AMR can help capture logical relationships
        on multiple choice question answering (MCQA) tasks. We propose neural architectures
        that utilize linearised AMR graphs in combination with pre-trained language
        models. While these models are not able to outperform text-only baselines,
        they correctly solve different instances than the text models, suggesting
        complementary abilities. Error analysis further reveals that AMR parsing quality
        is the most prominent challenge, especially regarding inputs with multiple
        sentences. We conduct a theoretical analysis of how logical relations are
        represented in AMR and conclude it might be helpful in some logical statements
        but not for others.

        a set of agents are asked to act in a particular ordering, called the action
        sequence. Each agent acts in a way that gives her the maximum possible value,
        given the actions of the agents who preceded her in the action sequence. Our
        goal is to compute action sequences that yield approximately optimal total
        value to the agents (a.k.a., social welfare). We assume query access to the
        value  that the agent i gets when she acts after the agents in the ordered
        set S.We establish tight bounds on the social welfare that can be achieved

        one item per round, which brings interesting challenges to finding efficient
        and/or fair repeated matchings. A particular feature of our model is that
        the value of an agent for an item in some round depends on the number of rounds
        in which the item has been used by the agent in the past. We present a set
        of positive and negative results about the efficiency and fairness of repeated
        matchings. For example, when items are goods, a variation of the well-studied
        fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one good () can be satisfied under
        certain conditions. Furthermore, it is intractable to achieve fairness and
        (approximate) efficiency simultaneously, even though they are achievable separately.

        guarantees when allocating divisible goods. And while it seems to lose its
        luster when applied to indivisible goods, we show that, in fact, the MNW solution
        is strikingly fair even in that setting. In particular, we prove that it selects
        allocations that are envy-free up to one good—a compelling notion that is
        quite elusive when coupled with economic efficiency. We also establish that
        the MNW solution provides a good approximation to another popular (yet possibly
        infeasible) fairness property, the maximin share guarantee, in theory and—even
        more so—in practice. While finding the MNW solution is computationally hard,

        pure Nash equilibria in cut games. This is the first improvement to the previously
        best-known bound of 3, due to the work of Bhalgat, Chakraborty, and Khanna
        from EC 2010. Our algorithm is based on a general recipe proposed by Caragiannis,
        Fanelli, Gravin, and Skopalik from FOCS 2011 and applied on several potential
        games since then. The first novelty of our work is the introduction of a phase
        that can identify subsets of players who can simultaneously improve their
        utilities considerably. This is done via semidefinite programming and randomized
        rounding. In particular, a negative objective …

      abstract: 'The Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction is the primary auction
        used for monetizing the use of the Internet. It is well-known that truthtelling
        is not a dominant strategy in this auction and that inefficient equilibria

      abstract: We study the classic problem of dividing a collection of indivisible
        resources in a fair and efficient manner among a set of agents having varied
        preferences. Pareto optimality is a standard notion of economic efficiency,
        which states that it should be impossible to find an allocation that improves
        some agent's utility without reducing any other's. On the other hand, a fundamental
        notion of fairness in resource allocation settings is that of envy-freeness,
        which renders an allocation to be fair if every agent (weakly) prefers her
        own bundle over that of any other agent's bundle. Unfortunately, an envy-free
        allocation may not exist if we wish to divide a collection of indivisible
        items. Introducing randomness is a typical way of circumventing the non-existence
        of solutions, and therefore, allocation lotteries, i.e., distributions over
        allocations have been explored while relaxing the notion of fairness to ex-ante
        envy freeness. We consider a general fair division setting with  agents and
        a family of admissible -partitions of an underlying set of items. Every agent
        is endowed with partition-based utilities, which specify her cardinal utility
        for each bundle of items in every admissible partition. In such fair division
        instances, Cole and Tao (2021) have proved that an ex-ante envy-free and Pareto-optimal
        allocation lottery is always guaranteed to exist. We strengthen their result
        while examining the computational complexity of the above total problem and
        establish its membership in the complexity class PPAD. Furthermore, for instances
        with a constant number of agents, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm to
        find an ex-ante envy-free and Pareto-optimal allocation lottery …

      abstract: We adopt a utilitarian perspective on social choice, assuming that
        agents have (possibly latent) utility functions over some space of alternatives.
        For many reasons one might consider mechanisms, or social choice functions,
        that only have access to the ordinal rankings of alternatives by the individual
        agents rather than their utility functions. In this context, one possible
        objective for a social choice function is the maximization of (expected) social
        welfare relative to the information contained in these rankings. We study
        such optimal social choice functions under three different models, and underscore
        the important role played by scoring functions. In our worst-case model, no
        assumptions are made about the underlying distribution and we analyze the
        worst-case distortion---or degree to which the selected alternative does not
        maximize social welfare---of optimal social choice functions. In our average-case

      abstract: '{\em Distortion} is a well-established notion for quantifying the
        loss of social welfare that may occur in voting. As voting rules take as input
        only ordinal information, they are essentially forced to neglect the exact
        values the agents have for the alternatives. Thus, in worst-case electorates,
        voting rules may return low social welfare alternatives and have high distortion.
        Accompanying voting rules with a small number of cardinal queries per agent
        may reduce distortion considerably. To explore distortion beyond worst-case
        conditions, we introduce a simple stochastic model, according to which the
        values the agents have for the alternatives are drawn independently from a
        common probability distribution. This gives rise to so-called {\em impartial
        culture electorates}. We refine the definition of distortion so that it is
        suitable for this stochastic setting and show that, rather surprisingly, all
        voting rules have high distortion {\em on average}. On the positive side,
        for the fundamental case where the agents have random {\em binary} values
        for the alternatives, we present a mechanism that achieves approximately optimal
        average distortion by making a {\em single} cardinal query per agent. This
        enables us to obtain slightly suboptimal average distortion bounds for general
        distributions using a simple randomized mechanism that makes one query per
        agent. We complement these results by presenting new tradeoffs between the
        distortion and the number of queries per agent in the traditional worst-case
        setting.'

      abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) allows deep neural networks to learn from
        related tasks by sharing parameters with other networks. In practice, however,
        MTL involves searching an enormous space of possible parameter sharing architectures
        to find (a) the layers or subspaces that benefit from sharing,(b) the appropriate
        amount of sharing, and (c) the appropriate relative weights of the different
        task losses. Recent work has addressed each of the above problems in isolation.
        In this work we present an approach that learns a latent multi-task architecture
        that jointly addresses (a)–(c). We present experiments on synthetic data and
        data from OntoNotes 5.0, including four different tasks and seven different
        domains. Our extension consistently outperforms previous approaches to learning
        latent architectures for multi-task problems and achieves up to 15% average
        error reductions over common approaches to MTL.

        rely on representation learning and utilize pre-trained word embeddings. There
        currently exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings,
        but they contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social
        media has increased. In this paper we release emoji2vec, pre-trained embeddings
        for all Unicode emoji which are learned from their description in the Unicode
        emoji standard. The resulting emoji embeddings can be readily used in downstream
        social natural language processing applications alongside word2vec. We demonstrate,
        for the downstream task of sentiment analysis, that emoji embeddings learned
        from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model trained on a large collection
        of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in which emoji need to appear
        frequently in order to estimate a representation.

      abstract: Data-driven analyses of biases in historical texts can help illuminate
        the origin and development of biases prevailing in modern society. However,
        digitised historical documents pose a challenge for NLP practitioners as these
        corpora suffer from errors introduced by optical character recognition (OCR)
        and are written in an archaic language. In this paper, we investigate the
        continuities and transformations of bias in historical newspapers published
        in the Caribbean during the colonial era (18th to 19th centuries). Our analyses
        are performed along the axes of gender, race, and their intersection. We examine
        these biases by conducting a temporal study in which we measure the development
        of lexical associations using distributional semantics models and word embeddings.
        Further, we evaluate the effectiveness of techniques designed to process OCR-generated
        data and assess their stability when trained on and applied to the noisy historical
        newspapers. We find that there is a trade-off between the stability of the
        word embeddings and their compatibility with the historical dataset. We provide
        evidence that gender and racial biases are interdependent, and their intersection
        triggers distinct effects. These findings align with the theory of intersectionality,
        which stresses that biases affecting people with multiple marginalised identities
        compound to more than the sum of their constituents.

      abstract: Stance Detection is concerned with identifying the attitudes expressed
        by an author towards a target of interest. This task spans a variety of domains
        ranging from social media opinion identification to detecting the stance for
        a legal claim. However, the framing of the task varies within these domains,
        in terms of the data collection protocol, the label dictionary and the number
        of available annotations. Furthermore, these stance annotations are significantly
        imbalanced on a per-topic and inter-topic basis. These make multi-domain stance
        detection a challenging task, requiring standardization and domain adaptation.
        To overcome this challenge, we propose opic fficient anc etection (TESTED),
        consisting of a topic-guided diversity sampling technique and a contrastive
        objective that is used for fine-tuning a stance classifier. We evaluate the
        method on an existing benchmark of  datasets with in-domain, i.e. all topics
        seen and out-of-domain, i.e. unseen topics, experiments. The results show
        that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art with an average of  F1 points
        increase in-domain, and is more generalizable with an averaged increase of  F1
        on out-of-domain evaluation while using  of the training data. We show that
        our sampling technique mitigates both inter- and per-topic class imbalances.
        Finally, our analysis demonstrates that the contrastive learning objective
        allows the model a more pronounced segmentation of samples with varying labels.

      abstract: Stance detection is the task of classifying the attitude expressed
        in a text towards a target such as Hillary Clinton to be "positive", negative"
        or "neutral". Previous work has assumed that either the target is mentioned
        in the text or that training data for every target is given. This paper considers
        the more challenging version of this task, where targets are not always mentioned
        and no training data is available for the test targets. We experiment with
        conditional LSTM encoding, which builds a representation of the tweet that
        is dependent on the target, and demonstrate that it outperforms encoding the
        tweet and the target independently. Performance is improved further when the
        conditional model is augmented with bidirectional encoding. We evaluate our
        approach on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus achieving
        performance second best only to a system trained on semi-automatically labelled
        tweets for the test target. When such weak supervision is added, our approach
        achieves state-of-the-art results.

      abstract: Explanations of neural models aim to reveal a model's decision-making
        process for its predictions. However, recent work shows that current methods
        giving explanations such as saliency maps or counterfactuals can be misleading,
        as they are prone to present reasons that are unfaithful to the model's inner
        workings. This work explores the challenging question of evaluating the faithfulness
        of natural language explanations (NLEs). To this end, we present two tests.
        First, we propose a counterfactual input editor for inserting reasons that
        lead to counterfactual predictions but are not reflected by the NLEs. Second,
        we reconstruct inputs from the reasons stated in the generated NLEs and check
        how often they lead to the same predictions. Our tests can evaluate emerging
        NLE models, proving a fundamental tool in the development of faithful NLEs.

        approach, our system performs at a competitive level with the complex ensembles
        of the top two winning teams. We therefore propose our system as the 'simple

      abstract: Uncertainty approximation in text classification is an important area
        with applications in domain adaptation and interpretability. The most widely
        used uncertainty approximation method is Monte Carlo Dropout, which is computationally
        expensive as it requires multiple forward passes through the model. A cheaper
        alternative is to simply use a softmax to estimate model uncertainty. However,
        prior work has indicated that the softmax can generate overconfident uncertainty
        estimates and can thus be tricked into producing incorrect predictions. In
        this paper, we perform a thorough empirical analysis of both methods on five
        datasets with two base neural architectures in order to reveal insight into
        the trade-offs between the two. We compare the methods' uncertainty approximations

        making the process prone to human errors, which can be potentially critical.
        There is therefore a great research and industry interest in automating the
        sewer inspection process. Previous research have been focused on working with
        2D image data, similar to how inspections are currently conducted. There is,
        however, a clear potential for utilizing recent advances within 3D computer
        vision for this task. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of applying
        two modern deep learning methods, DGCNN and PointNet, on a new publicly available
        sewer point cloud dataset. As point cloud data from real sewers is scarce,
        we investigate using synthetic data to bootstrap the training process. We
        investigate four data scenarios, and find that training on synthetic data
        and fine-tune on real data gives the best results, increasing the metrics
        by 6-10 percentage points for the best model. Data and code is available at

        system that informs users about their position and potential hazards. We propose

        and their volumes. Computer vision techniques have recently been used for
        solving this real-world industrial application. Such techniques are facing

      abstract: There exist no publicly available annotated underwater multi-object
        tracking (MOT) datasets captured in turbid environments. To remedy this we
        propose the BrackishMOT dataset with focus on tracking schools of small fish,
        which is a notoriously difficult MOT task. BrackishMOT consists of 98 sequences
        captured in the wild. Alongside the novel dataset, we present baseline results
        by training a state-of-the-art tracker. Additionally, we propose a framework
        for creating synthetic sequences in order to expand the dataset. The framework
        consists of animated fish models and realistic underwater environments. We
        analyse the effects of including synthetic data during training and show that
        a combination of real and synthetic underwater training data can enhance tracking
        performance. Links to code and data can be found athttps://www.vap.aau.dk/brackishmot.

      abstract: Automatic anomaly detection for surveillance purposes has become an
        integral part of accident prevention and early warning systems. The lack of
        sufficient real datasets for training and testing such detectors has pushed
        a lot of research into synthetic data generation. A hybrid approach by combining
        real images with synthetic elements has been proven to produce the best training
        results.We aim to extend this hybrid approach by combining the backgrounds
        and real people captured in datasets with synthetic elements which dynamically
        react to real pedestrians and create more coherent video sequences. Our pipeline
        is the first to directly augment synthetic objects like handbags and suitcases
        to real pedestrians and provides dynamic occlusion between real and synthetic
        elements in the images. The pipeline can be easily used to produce a continuous
        stream of randomized augmented normal and abnormal data for training and testing.
        As a basis for our augmented images, we use one of the most widely used classical
        datasets for anomaly detection - the UCSD dataset. We show that the synthetic
        data produced by our proposed pipeline can be used to make the dataset harder
        for state-of-the-art models, by introducing more varied and challenging anomalies.
        We also demonstrate that the additional synthetic normal data can boost the
        performance of some models. Our solution can be easily extended with additional
        3D models, animations, and anomaly scenarios.

      abstract: Generating 3D object variations through style transfer models applied
        to their textures is an easy way for creating content for games and XR applications.
        Most workflows focus on either generating albedo textures only without changing
        the underlying surface and not touching the underlying surface or transforming
        the 3D object directly, which is computationally and resource-heavy. In this
        paper, we present an initial exploration of an in-between solution that aims
        to combine the style transfer of albedo textures with the generation of additional
        maps, such as normal, displacement, and roughness. The results show that the
        pipeline can generate variations based on different styles, which would enable
        the addition of smaller 3D-style surface features to objects without transforming
        their meshes. The project code and generated textures will be available at

      abstract: The wind energy sector faces a constant need for annual inspections
        of wind turbine blades for damage, erosion and cracks. These inspections are
        an important part of the wind turbine life cycle and can be very costly and
        hazardous to specialists. This has led to the use of automated drone inspections
        and the need for accurate, robust and inexpensive systems for localization
        of drones relative to the wing. Due to the lack of visual and geometrical
        features on the wind turbine blade, conventional SLAM algorithms have a limited
        use. We propose a cost-effective, easy to implement and extend system for
        on-site outdoor localization and mapping in low feature environment using
        the inexpensive RPLIDAR and an 9-DOF IMU. Our algorithm geometrically simplifies
        the wind turbine blade 2D cross-section to an elliptical model and uses it
        for distance and shape correction. We show that the proposed algorithm gives
        localization error between 1 and 20 cm depending on the position of the LiDAR
        compared to the blade and a maximum mapping error of 4 cm at distances between
        1.5 and 3 meters from the blade. These results are satisfactory for positioning
        and capturing the overall shape of the blade.

        Consequently, with greater or lesser success, optimal filterbank learning

        Two approaches are examined: filterbank matrix learning in the power spectral

        filterbank. Filterbank parameters are optimized jointly with a modern deep

      abstract: Despite the maturity of modern speaker verification technology, its
        performance still significantly degrades when facing non-neutrally-phonated
        (e.g., shouted and whispered) speech. To address this issue, in this paper,
        we propose a new speaker embedding compensation method based on a minimum
        mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This method models the joint distribution
        of the vocal effort transfer vector and non-neutrally-phonated embedding spaces
        and operates in a principal component analysis domain to cope with non-neutrally-phonated
        speech data scarcity. Experiments are carried out using a cutting-edge speaker
        verification system integrating a powerful self-supervised pre-trained model
        for speech representation. In comparison with a state-of-the-art embedding
        compensation method, the proposed MMSE estimator yields superior and competitive
        equal error rate results when tackling shouted and whispered speech, respectively.

      abstract: Measuring brain activity simultaneously from two people interacting
        is intuitively appealing if one is interested in putative neural markers of
        social interaction. However, given the complex nature of interactions, it
        has proven difficult to carry out two-person brain imaging experiments in
        a methodologically feasible and conceptually relevant way. Only a small number
        of recent studies have put this into practice, using fMRI, EEG, or NIRS. Here,
        we review two main two-brain methodological approaches, each with two conceptual
        strategies. The first group has employed two-brain fMRI recordings, studying
        (1) turn-based interactions on the order of seconds, or (2) pseudo-interactive
        scenarios, where only one person is scanned at a time, investigating the flow
        of information between brains. The second group of studies has recorded dual
        EEG/NIRS from two people interacting, in (1) face-to-face turn-based interactions,
        investigating functional connectivity between theory-of-mind regions of interacting
        partners, or in (2) continuous mutual interactions on millisecond timescales,
        to measure coupling between the activity in one person's brain and the activity
        in the other's brain. We discuss the questions these approaches have addressed,
        and consider scenarios when simultaneous two-brain recordings are needed.
        Furthermore, we suggest that (1) quantification of inter-personal neural effects
        via measures of emergence, and (2) multivariate decoding models that generalize
        source-specific features of interaction, may provide novel tools to study
        brains in interaction. This may allow for a better understanding of social
        cognition as both representation and …

      abstract: Objective Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly heterogeneous,
        and identification of quantifiable biomarkers that could pave the way for
        targeted treatment remains a challenge. Most previous electroencephalography
        (EEG) studies on PTSD have been limited to specific handpicked features, and
        their findings have been highly variable and inconsistent. Therefore, to disentangle
        the role of promising EEG biomarkers, we developed a machine learning framework
        to investigate a wide range of commonly used EEG biomarkers in order to identify
        which features or combinations of features are capable of characterizing PTSD
        and potential subtypes. Approach We recorded 5 min of eyes-closed and 5 min
        of eyes-open resting-state EEG from 202 combat-exposed veterans (53% with
        probable PTSD and 47% combat-exposed controls). Multiple spectral, temporal,
        and connectivity features were computed and …

      abstract: A central question in social cognition research is how people coordinate
        their bodily rhythms, and how important reciprocity of interaction is for
        interpersonal coordination. Previous research has primarily focused on interpersonal
        action coordination, which has been shown to be facilitated by mechanisms
        of prediction and mutual adaption. Recent research is beginning to show that
        people also coordinate their physiological rhythms (i.e., respiration, heart
        rhythms) when they engage in natural forms of social interaction, such as
        conversation, choir singing, and rituals. However, the mechanisms underlying
        interpersonal physiological synchronization remain obscure, and could provide
        insight into the dynamic mechanisms that underlie continuous and regulatory,
        rather than instrumental, joint actions. Using real-time biofeedback, we investigated
        whether people synchronize their respiration rhythms by forming a joint …

      abstract: Developments in cognitive neuroscience have led to the emergence of
        hyperscanning, the simultaneous measurement of brain activity from multiple
        people. Hyperscanning holds promise for the study of social cognition, including
        joint action, because of its potential to capture neural processes that occur
        within and between people as they coordinate actions toward a shared goal.
        Skeptical voices have, however, questioned the utility of hyperscanning based
        on concerns regarding interpretability of inter-brain measures and lack of
        a unifying theoretical approach. Here, we provide a practical guide for researchers
        considering using hyperscanning to study joint action and seeking to mitigate
        these concerns. We focus specifically on EEG hyperscanning, which is widely
        available and optimally suited for capturing fine-grained temporal dynamics
        of action coordination. Our guidelines cover questions that are likely to
        arise when planning a hyperscanning project, ranging from whether hyperscanning
        is appropriate for answering one’s research questions to considerations for
        study design, dependent variable selection, data analysis, and visualization.
        Our perspective is that benefits of hyperscanning can be maximized, and interpretability
        issues mitigated, if joint action researchers follow clear guidelines–including
        those provided here–to carefully consider the theoretical implications of
        their research design choices and other methodological decisions.

      abstract: Collective rituals are present in all known societies, but their function
        is a matter of long-standing debates. Field observations suggest that they
        may enhance social cohesion and that their effects are not limited to those
        actively performing but affect the audience as well. Here we show physiological
        effects of synchronized arousal in a Spanish fire-walking ritual, between
        active participants and related spectators, but not participants and other
        members of the audience. We assessed arousal by heart rate dynamics and applied
        nonlinear mathematical analysis to heart rate data obtained from 38 participants.
        We compared synchronized arousal between fire-walkers and spectators. For
        this comparison, we used recurrence quantification analysis on individual
        data and cross-recurrence quantification analysis on pairs of participants'
        data. These methods identified fine-grained commonalities of arousal during
        the 30-min …

      abstract: To study the mechanisms of coordination that are fundamental to successful
        interactions we carried out a joint finger tapping experiment in which pairs
        of participants were asked to maintain a given beat while synchronizing to
        an auditory signal coming from the other person or the computer. When both
        were hearing each other, the pair became a coupled, mutually and continuously
        adaptive unit of two “hyper-followers”, with their intertap intervals (ITIs)
        oscillating in opposite directions on a tap-to-tap basis. There was thus no
        evidence for the emergence of a leader–follower strategy. We also found that
        dyads were equally good at synchronizing with the irregular, but responsive
        other as with the predictable, unresponsive computer. However, they performed
        worse when the “other” was both irregular and unresponsive. We thus propose
        that interpersonal coordination is facilitated by the mutual abilities to
        (a) predict the …

      abstract: We introduce the Aeolus component model, which is specifically designed
        to capture realistic scenarios arising when configuring and deploying distributed
        applications in the so-called cloud environments, where interconnected components
        can be deployed on clusters of heterogeneous virtual machines, which can be

        adopt the metrics typically used for individual solvers (eg, runtime or solution
        quality) or employ more specific evaluation metrics (eg, by measuring how
        close the meta-solver gets to its virtual best performance). In this paper,
        based on some recently published works, we provide an overview of different

      abstract: Microservices is an emerging paradigm for the development of distributed
        systems that, originating from Service-Oriented Architecture, focuses on the
        small dimension, the loose coupling, and the dynamic topology of services.
        Microservices are particularly appropriate for the development of distributed
        systems in the Cloud. However, their dynamic nature calls for suitable techniques
        for their automatic deployment. In this paper we address this problem and
        we propose JRO (Jolie Redeployment Optimiser), a tool for the automatic and
        optimised deployment of microservices written in the Jolie language. The tool
        uses Zephyrus, a state of the art tool that automatically generates a fully
        detailed Service-Oriented Architecture configuration starting from a partial
        and abstract description of the target application.

      abstract: Programming distributed applications free from communication deadlocks
        and race conditions is complex. Preserving these properties when applications
        are updated at runtime is even harder. We present a choreographic approach
        for programming updatable, distributed applications. We define a choreography
        language, called Dynamic Interaction-Oriented Choreography (AIOC), that allows
        the programmer to specify, from a global viewpoint, which parts of the application
        can be updated. At runtime, these parts may be replaced by new AIOC fragments
        from outside the application. AIOC programs are compiled, generating code
        for each participant in a process-level language called Dynamic Process-Oriented
        Choreographies (APOC). We prove that APOC distributed applications generated
        from AIOC specifications are deadlock free and race free and that these properties
        hold also after any runtime update. We instantiate the theoretical model above
        into a programming framework called Adaptable Interaction-Oriented Choreographies
        in Jolie (AIOCJ) that comprises an integrated development environment, a compiler
        from an extension of AIOCs to distributed Jolie programs, and a runtime environment
        to support their execution.

        software developers and management when it comes to the implementation of
        security and privacy measures, ii) difficulties in adapting company practices
        in light of implementing GDPR compliance, and iii) different views on the

        was to develop digital solutions that address the needs of patients with T2DM,
        designed from the user’s perspective. The goal was to address the patients’

        and format of the solutions.Methods: Using participatory methods, we conducted
        3 cocreation workshops in collaboration with the Danish Diabetes Association,
        with 20 persons with T2DM and 11 stakeholders across workshops: user experience
        designers, researchers, and diabetes experts including a diabetes nurse. The

      abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a large disease burden worldwide and represents
        an increasing and complex challenge for all societies. For the individual,
        T2D is a complex, multi-dimensional, and long-term challenge to manage, and
        it is challenging to establish and maintain good communication between the
        patient and healthcare professionals. This article presents DiaFocus, which
        is a mobile health sensing application for long-term ambulatory management
        of T2D. DiaFocus supports an adaptive collection of physiological, behavioral,
        and contextual data in combination with ecological assessments of psycho-social
        factors. This data is used for improving patient-clinician communication during
        consultations. DiaFocus is built using a generic data collection framework
        for mobile and wearable sensing and is highly extensible and customizable.

      abstract: We posit the concept of Mobility Work to describe efforts of moving
        about people and things as part of accomplishing tasks. Mobility work can
        be seen as a spatial parallel to the concept of articulation work proposed
        by the sociologist Anselm Strauss. Articulation work describes efforts of
        coordination necessary in cooperative work, but focuses, we argue, mainly
        on the temporal aspects of cooperative work. As a supplement, the concept
        of mobility work focuses on the spatial aspects of cooperative work. Whereas
        actors seek to diminish the amount of articulation work needed in collaboration
        by constructing Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs), actors minimise mobility
        work by constructing Standard Operation Configurations (SOCs). We apply the
        concept of mobility work to the ethnography of hospital work, and argue that
        mobility arises because of the need to get access to people, places, knowledge

      abstract: A substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder experience
        daily subsyndromal mood swings, and the term “mood instability” reflecting
        the variability in mood seems associated with poor prognostic factors, including
        impaired functioning, and increased risk of hospitalization and relapse. During
        the last decade, we have developed and tested a smartphone-based system for
        monitoring bipolar disorder. The present SmartBipolar randomized controlled
        trial (RCT) aims to investigate whether (1) daily smartphone-based outpatient
        monitoring and treatment including clinical feedback versus (2) daily smartphone-based

        are invited to participate as part of their specialized outpatient treatment
        for patients with bipolar disorder in Mental Health Services in the Capital

      abstract: Context-awareness is a key concept in ubiquitous computing. But to
        avoid developing dedicated context-awareness sub-systems for specific application
        areas there is a need for more generic programming frameworks. Such frameworks
        can help the programmer develop and deploy context-aware applications faster.
        This paper describes the Java Context-Awareness Framework – JCAF, which is
        a Java-based context-awareness infrastructure and programming API for creating
        context-aware computer applications. The paper presents the design goals of
        JCAF, its runtime architecture, and its programming model. The paper presents
        some applications of using JCAF in three different applications and discusses
        lessons learned from using JCAF.

        sometimes seems to be a technology looking for a purpose. In this paper we
        report on the application of context-aware computing for medical work in hospitals,
        which has appeared to be a strong case for applying context-aware computing.
        We present the design of a context-aware pill container and a context-aware
        hospital bed, both of which reacts and adapts according to what is happening
        in their context. The applications have been evaluated in a number of workshop
        with clinicians and patients. Based on this empirical work of designing, developing,
        and evaluating context-aware clinical applications, the paper outlines some
        key design principles for a context-awareness framework, supporting the development
        and deployment of context-aware clinical computer applications.

      abstract: This paper proposes a mathematical framework for dynamic pricing in
        an energy community to enable the provision of capacity limitation services
        to the distribution grid. In this framework, the energy community complies
        with a time-variant limit on its maximum power import from the distribution
        grid in exchange for grid tariff discounts. A bi-level optimization model
        is developed to implicitly coordinate the energy usage of prosumers within
        the community. In the upper-level problem, the community manager minimizes
        the total operational cost of the community based on reduced grid tariffs
        and power capacity limits by setting time-variant and prosumer-specific prices.
        In the lower-level problem, each prosumer subsequently adjusts their energy
        usage over a day to minimize their individual operational cost. This framework
        allows the community manager to maintain central economic market properties
        such as budget balance and individual rationality for prosumers. We show how
        the community benefits can be allocated to prosumers either in an equal or
        a proportional manner. The proposed model is eventually reformulated into
        a mixed integer second-order cone program and thereafter applied to a distribution
        grid case study.

      abstract: The cost competitiveness of green hydrogen production via electrolysis
        presents a significant challenge for its large-scale adoption. One potential
        solution to make electrolyzers profitable is to diversify their products and
        participate in various markets, generating additional revenue streams. Electrolyzers
        can be utilized as flexible loads and participate in various frequency-supporting
        ancillary service markets by adjusting their operating set points. This paper
        develops a mixed-integer linear model, deriving an optimal scheduling strategy
        for an electrolyzer providing Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) services
        in the Nordic synchronous region. Depending on the hydrogen price and demand,
        results show that the provision of various FCR services, particularly those
        for critical frequency conditions (FCR-D), could significantly increase the
        profit of the electrolyzer.

      abstract: This paper investigates how a thermostatically controlled load can
        deliver flexibility either in form of manual frequency restoration reserves
        (mFRR) or load shifting, and which one is financially more appealing to such
        a load. A supermarket freezer is considered as a representative flexible load,
        and a grey-box model describing its temperature dynamics is developed using
        real data from a supermarket in Denmark. Taking into account price and activation
        uncertainties, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program is formulated
        to maximize the flexibility value from the freezer. For practical reasons,
        we propose a linear policy to determine regulating power bids, and then linearize
        the mFRR activation conditions through the McCormick relaxation approach.
        For computational ease, we develop a decomposition technique, splitting the
        problem to a set of smaller subproblems, one per scenario. Examined on an
        out-of-sample simulation based on real Danish spot and balancing market prices
        in 2022, load shifting shows to be more profitable than mFRR provision, but
        is also more consequential for temperature deviations in the freezer.

        to maximize its profit through making strategic planning, i.e., storage sizing,

      abstract: We address potential synergy among flexible demands and how they may
        earn more collectively than individually by forming a coalition and bidding
        to the reserve market. We consider frequency-supporting ancillary service
        markets, particularly the manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR) market.
        The coalition of flexible demands provides more reliable mFRR services, where
        in comparison to individual demands, is penalized less for their potential
        failure and is paid more for their successful activation. This synergy effect
        is quantified as a function of the number of homogeneous assets in the coalition.
        A subsequent payment allocation mechanism using Shapley values is proposed
        to distribute the total earnings of the coalition among demands, while incentivizing
        them to remain in the coalition. For our numerical study, we use real price
        data from the Danish mFRR market in 2022.

      abstract: We consider speech enhancement for signals picked up in one noisy
        environment that must be rendered to a listener in another noisy environment.
        For both far-end noise reduction and near-end listening enhancement, it has
        been shown that excessive focus on noise suppression or intelligibility maximization
        may lead to excessive speech distortions and quality degradations in favorable
        noise conditions, where intelligibility is already at ceiling level. Recently
        [1,2] propose to remedy this with a minimum processing framework that either
        reduces noise or enhances listening a minimum amount given that a certain
        intelligibility criterion is still satisfied. Additionally, it has been shown
        that joint consideration of both environments improves speech enhancement
        performance. In this paper, we formulate a joint far- and near-end minimum
        processing framework, that improves intelligibility while limiting speech
        distortions in favorable noise conditions. We provide closed-form solutions
        to specific boundary scenarios and investigate performance for the general
        case using numerical optimization. We also show that concatenating existing
        minimum processing far- and near-end enhancement methods preserves the effects
        of the initial methods. Results show that the joint optimization can further
        improve performance compared to the concatenated approach.

      abstract: In this paper we propose a new design of LT codes, which decreases
        the amount of necessary overhead in comparison to existing designs. The design
        focuses on a parameter of the LT decoding process called the ripple size.
        This parameter was also a key element in the design proposed in the original
        work by Luby. Specifically, Luby argued that an LT code should provide a constant
        ripple size during decoding. In this work we show that the ripple size should
        decrease during decoding, in order to reduce the necessary overhead. Initially
        we motivate this claim by analytical results related to the redundancy within
        an LT code. We then propose a new design procedure, which can provide any
        desired achievable decreasing ripple size. The new design procedure is evaluated
        and compared to the current state of the art through simulations. This reveals

      abstract: We study feedback control over erasure channels with packet-dropouts.
        To achieve robustness with respect to packet-dropouts, the controller transmits
        data packets containing plant input predictions, which minimize a finite horizon
        cost function. To reduce the data size of packets, we propose to adopt sparsity-promoting
        optimizations, namely, l 1  - l 2  and l 2 -constrained l 0  optimizations,
        for which efficient algorithms exist. We show how to design the tuning parameters
        to ensure (practical) stability of the resulting feedback control systems
        when the number of consecutive packet-dropouts is bounded.

        channels
    P7rpiNUAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC:
      abstract: We study state estimation via wireless sensors over fading channels.
        Packet loss probabilities depend upon time-varying channel gains, packet lengths
        and transmission power levels of the sensors. Measurements are coded into
        packets by using either independent coding or distributed zero-error coding.
        At the gateway, a time-varying Kalman filter uses the received packets to
        provide the state estimates. To trade sensor energy expenditure for state
        estimation accuracy, we develop a predictive control algorithm which, in an
        online fashion, determines the transmission power levels and codebooks to
        be used by the sensors. To further conserve sensor energy, the controller
        is located at the gateway and sends coarsely quantized power increment commands,
        only whenever deemed necessary. Simulations based on real channel measurements
        illustrate that the proposed method gives excellent results.

      abstract: This paper studies discrete-time control systems subject to average
        data-rate limits. We focus on a situation where a noisy linear system has
        been designed assuming transparent feedback and, due to implementation constraints,
        a source-coding scheme (with unity signal transfer function) has to be deployed
        in the feedback path. For this situation, and by focusing on a class of source-coding
        schemes built around entropy coded dithered quantizers, we develop a framework
        to deal with average data-rate constraints in a tractable manner that combines
        ideas from both information and control theories. As an illustration of the
        uses of our framework, we apply it to study the interplay between stability
        and average data-rates in the considered architecture. It is shown that the
        proposed class of coding schemes can achieve mean square stability at average
        data-rates that are, at most, 1.254 bits per sample away from the …

      abstract: We study a control architecture for linear time-invariant plants with
        random disturbances and where a network is placed between the controller output
        and the plant input. The network imposes a constraint on the expected bit-rate
        and is affected by random independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
        dropouts. Dropout-rates and acknowledgments of receipt are not available at
        the controller side. To achieve robustness with respect to i.i.d. dropouts,
        the controller transmits data packets containing quantized plant input predictions.
        These are provided by an appropriate optimal entropy coded dithered lattice
        vector quantizer. Within this context, we derive stochastic stability results
        and provide a noise-shaping model of the closed loop system. This model is
        employed for performance analysis by using rate-distortion theory.

      abstract: A stereophonic acoustic system offers better spatial realism in teleconferencing
        and other acoustic applications compared to its monophonic counterpart. However,
        it suffers from acoustic echo, which is inevitable in acoustic systems. In
        literature, several stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation (SAEC) techniques
        have been proposed under the assumption that the echo path is linear. However,
        electronic components introduce nonlinearities into the system, which renders
        the effect of the echo canceller to diminish in SAEC. As a result, there exists
        a scope to investigate further the problem of SAEC when the system is affected
        by nonlinear distortions. Kernel-based adaptive filtering techniques have
        been explored for nonlinear system identification in literature due to their
        superior performance compared to their linear counterparts. Hence, in this
        paper, we propose a family of kernel-based adaptive filtering algorithms …

      abstract: The intelligibility and quality of speech from a mobile phone or public
        announcement system are often affected by background noise in the listening
        environment. By pre-processing the speech signal it is possible to improve
        the speech intelligibility and quality — this is known as near-end listening
        enhancement (NLE). Although, existing NLE techniques are able to greatly increase
        intelligibility in harsh noise environments, in favorable noise conditions
        the intelligibility of speech reaches a ceiling where it cannot be further
        enhanced. Actually, the focus of existing methods solely on improving the
        intelligibility causes unnecessary processing of the speech signal and leads
        to speech distortions and quality degradations. In this paper, we provide
        a new rationale for NLE, where the target speech is minimally processed in
        terms of a processing penalty, provided that a certain performance constraint,
        e.g., intelligibility, is …

        in 1993. A group of students enrolled in the ‘newspapers of the future freshman

        personalized online news site,‘fishWrap’. 1 Just a few years later, Nicholas
        Negroponte, founder of the MIT Media Lab, outlined a vision of what he labelled
        the ‘Daily Me’:‘Imagine a future in which your interface agent can read every
        newswire and newspaper and catch every TV and broadcast on the planet, and

      abstract: Between 2006 and 2011, a number of European public service broadcasting
        (PSB) organisations offered their website users the opportunity to create
        their own PSB homepage. The web customisation was conceived by the editors
        as a response to developments in commercial web services, particularly social
        networking and content aggregation services, but the customisation projects
        revealed tensions between the ideals of customer sovereignty and the editorial
        agenda-setting. This paper presents an overview of the PSB activities as well
        as reflections on the failure of the customisable PSB homepages. The analysis
        is based on interviews with the PSB editors involved in the projects and on
        studies of the interfaces and user comments. Commercial media customisation
        is discussed along with the PSB projects to identify similarities and differences.

      abstract: Public Service Media (PSM) websites are an interesting case for the
        implementation of recommender systems for media personaliza-tion, as the PSM
        organizations need to balance the optimization of exposure with traditional
        but ill-de ned PSM policy goals such as fairness, viewpoint diversity and
        transparency. Furthermore, the mathematical logic of recommender system needs
        to be adapted to the legacy broadcasting scheduling and publishing strategies
        and procedures. Finally, as the PSM organizations step into new territories,
        domestication and adaption of the recommender sys-tem technologies must take
        place while PSM organizations try to embrace the new knowledge and new professions
        associated with recommender systems. Based on 25 in-depth interviews conducted
        from December 2016 to April 2019, this paper presents a cross-European analysis
        of the implementation of recommender systems in nine European public service
        media organizations from eight countries. The ndings indicate that PSM organizations,
        although viewing personalisation as competitive necessity, approach rec-ommendation
        systems with hesitation in order to maintain core PSM-values in the online
        environment. Furthermore, although the collaborative ltering chosen by the
        PSM organizations indicate a user-centered approach, curation systems on top
        of recommender systems re-install a broadcaster-centric approach.

      abstract: In pre-digital times, the visibility of a news story was determined
        by the newspaper layout, the size of its headline and placement on the page,
        reflecting the editors’ assessment of the relevance of the story. Visual means
        of attention management applied by typographs signalled hierarchy of stories
        and the genre, topic and author, which were placed accordingly. With news
        on the web, new tools for managing attention have emerged. What was previously
        called ‘news articles’ or ‘news stories’ are now ‘content’in a database (Caswell,

        news on third-party platforms (Newman et al, 2022), being visible to audiences

      abstract: When Public Service Media (PSM) organisations introduce algorithmic
        recommender systems to suggest media content to users, fundamental values
        of PSM are challenged. Beyond being confronted with ubiquitous computer ethics
        problems of causality and transparency, also the identity of PSM as curator
        and agenda-setter is challenged. The algorithms represents rules for which
        content to present to whom, and in this sense they may discriminate and bias
        the exposure of diversity. Furthermore, on a practical level, the introduction
        of the systems shifts power within the organisations and changes the regulatory
        conditions. In this chapter we analyse two cases-the EBU-members' introduction
        of recommender systems and the Australian broadcaster ABC's experiences with
        the use of chatbots. We use these cases to exemplify the challenges that algorithmic
        systems poses to PSM organisations.

        to the functioning of society at large (Helmond, 2015; Plantin et al, 2018;
        van Dijck et al, 2018). Our goal here is to empirically investigate how platformization

      abstract: The ubiquity of social media use and the digital data traces it produces
        has triggered a potential methodological shift in the psychological sciences
        away from traditional, laboratory-based experimentation. The hope is that,
        by using computational social science methods to analyse large-scale observational
        data from social media, human behaviour can be studied with greater statistical
        power and ecological validity. However, current standards of null hypothesis
        significance testing and correlational statistics seem ill-suited to markedly
        noisy, high-dimensional social media datasets. We explore this point by probing
        the moral contagion phenomenon, whereby the use of moral-emotional language
        increases the probability of message spread. Through out-of-sample prediction,

      abstract: How people update their beliefs when faced with new information is
        integral to everyday life. A sizeable body of literature suggests that people's
        belief updating is optimistically biased, such that their beliefs are updated
        more in response to good news than bad news. However, recent research demonstrates
        that findings previously interpreted as evidence of optimistic belief updating
        may be the result of flaws in experimental design, rather than motivated reasoning.
        In light of this controversy, we conduct three pre-registered variations of
        the standard belief updating paradigm (combined N = 300) in which we test
        for asymmetric belief updating with neutral, non-valenced stimuli using analytic
        approaches found in previous research. We find evidence of seemingly biased

        has been a major focus of research across the social and computational sciences.
        Much of this work has focused on the role of social influence in promoting
        the wisdom of the crowd versus leading the crowd astray and has resulted in
        conflicting conclusions about how social network structure determines the

      abstract: A longstanding finding in the judgment and decision-making literature
        is that human decision performance can be improved with the help of a mechanical
        aid. Despite this observation and celebrated advances in computing technologies,
        recently presented evidence of algorithm aversion raises concerns about whether
        the potential of human-machine decision-making is undermined by a human tendency
        to discount algorithmic outputs. In this chapter, we examine the algorithm

      abstract: 'Despite abundant literature theorizing societal implications of algorithmic
        decision making, relatively little is known about the conditions that lead
        to the acceptance or rejection of algorithmically generated insights by individual
        users of decision aids. More specifically, recent findings of algorithm aversion—the
        reluctance of human forecasters to use superior but imperfect algorithms—raise
        questions about whether joint human‐algorithm decision making is feasible
        in practice. In this paper, we systematically review the topic of algorithm
        aversion as it appears in 61 peer‐reviewed articles between 1950 and 2018

      abstract: People increasingly turn to online social networks for information
        and debate. This means that the structures and properties of these networks,
        and the information they propagate, play crucial roles in the development
        of social beliefs, attitudes, and morals. Recently, research has shown that
        the presence of specific language drives the diffusion of moral messages,
        regardless of the informational quality, in a phenomenon dubbed moral contagion
        (Brady et al., 2017). Due to the widespread attention and implications of
        such findings for science and society, we investigate the presence of moral
        contagion across six sets of data that capture the communications of naturally-occurring
        networks on Twitter. Across a large corpus of diverse tweets (n= 525,229),
        we find moral contagion to be an inconsistent and often absent phenomenon
        that does not effectively predict message diffusion. The implications and
        reasons for this finding are discussed.

      abstract: Advances in computing capacities have given rise to a “digital  world”
        in which information can be accessed and shared at a faster  pace, larger
        scale, and lower cost than what was previously possible. While this new digital
        world has promised a more informed public, research over the past decade has
        raised major  concerns about the accuracy of people’s beliefs, pointing to
        increasing polarisation, anti-intellectualism, and conspiratorial thinking.
        Efforts to understand why the promise of the digital world has not been realised
        often follow one of two perspectives.  On one hand, psychological studies
        argue that humans process information irrationally to believe what they want
        to believe.  On the other hand, studies of new digital media argue that structural
        features of the digital world present distorted information to users.  In
        this thesis, I challenge these literatures by highlighting the limitations
        of widely-accepted research methods, and provide initial evidence that the
        same technologies denounced for undermining the integrity of our beliefs can
        be re-designed to promote accurate decision making. Using Herbert Simon’s
        theory of bounded rationality as an organising framework, I present three
        studies examining (1)optimistic belief updating as a psychological account
        of belief inaccuracy “in the mind,” (2) moral contagion as a structural account
        of belief inaccuracy “in the world,” and (3) rewiring algorithms as a novel
        digital tool to support belief accuracy online. Theoretical, methodological,
        and practical implications are discussed.

      abstract: Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) has been proposed as a
        first-line treatment for acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Its clinical use
        remains, however, controversial because of the modest benefits and numerous
        side-effects. We investigated if MPSS could protect spinal neurons and glia
        using an in vitro model of the rat spinal cord that enables recording reflexes,
        fictive locomotion and morphological analysis of damage. With this model,
        a differential lesion affecting mainly either neurons or glia can be produced
        via kainate-evoked excitotoxicity or application of a pathological medium
        (lacking O2 and glucose), respectively. MPSS (6–10 μM) applied for 24 h after
        1-h pathological medium protected astrocytes and oligodendrocytes especially
        in the ventrolateral white matter. This effect was accompanied by the return

      abstract: Although neuroprotection to contain the initial damage of spinal cord
        injury (SCI) is difficult, multicentre studies show that early neurosurgery
        under general anaesthesia confers positive benefits. An interesting hypothesis
        is that the general anaesthetic itself might largely contribute to neuroprotection,
        although in vivo clinical settings hamper studying this possibility directly.
        To further test neuroprotective effects of a widely used general anaesthetic,
        we studied if propofol could change the outcome of a rat isolated spinal cord
        SCI model involving excitotoxicity evoked by 1 h application of kainate with
        delayed consequences on neurons and locomotor network activity. Propofol (5

      abstract: 'Complete movement arrest has recently been reported to be induced
        in rodents by optogenetic stimulation of a subpopulation within the pedunculopontine
        nucleus (PPN). This evoked arrest appears conspicuously similar to freezing
        behavior often seen as a fear response in prey animals but could also be akin
        to the freezing of gait, which is a symptom of Parkinson''s disease. This
        introduces two perspectives on the functional roles of this sub-region: A
        hub for orchestrating fear-related responses or an omnipotent halting mechanism
        devoid of emotional components. To better understand this phenomenon and its
        cognitive component, we engage the distinct electrical brain activity, the
        hippocampal theta rhythm. This rhythm has a well-described contextual association
        between various aspects of cognition and behavior. It is prominent during
        locomotor activity in rodents and immobile yet aroused states like behavioral
        freezing. We recorded the electrical activity in the hippocampus of rats while
        walking and being arrested by PPN stimulation. A clear obstruction of the
        ongoing theta activity was associated with the motor arrest. The timescale
        of movement arrest was less than 200 ms, similar to the obstruction of the
        theta rhythm. Since, anxiety, fear, and behavioral freezing are associated
        with hippocampal theta rhythm, which we did not see during PPN stimulation,
        we suggest the induced motor arrest occurs without an associated emotional
        component.'

      abstract: The secondary phase of spinal cord injury arising after the primary

        intrinsic mechanisms of neuroprotection can spare motoneurons that are very

        spinal cord excitotoxicity monitored for up to 24 hr after the primary injury

        of heat shock proteins (HSP) to protect spinal motoneurons using celastrol
        to investigate if the rat spinal cord can upregulate HSP as neuroprotective
        mechanism. Despite its narrow range of drug safety in vitro, celastrol was
        not toxic to the rat spinal cord at 0.75 μM concentration and enhanced the

        from that to further progress science.The essay starts with a brief exposition

        lambda calculus, followed by a brief reflection on the necessary conditions
        for such a pivotal insight. Finally, I conclude by discussing what drove the
        invention of λ-calculus and how it may help further novel ideas within computational
        sciences. A word of warning before we begin; the topic of lambda calculus
        is complicated and I have purposefully omitted to discuss the efforts of Gottlob
        Frege, the Burali-Forti paradox, and the Kleene–Rosser paradox. Additionally,
        I have sacrificed rigorous definition in favour of comprehension and readability

      abstract: In neurological research, cognitive/behavioural evaluations typically
        has the traditional cognitive functions (eg working memory or spatial orientation)
        as the conceptual and methodological point of departure. However, such “functions”
        appear to be neither unitary nor homogenous (across individuals)-eg numerous
        cognitive tests can be demonstrated to be procedure-dependent. And additionally,
        there is growing evidence of unexpected individual differences and experience-dependency
        regarding traditional “functions”. Thus, the traditional system of cognitive
        functions needs to be modified. Presently, it is argued that the adequate
        focus is the applied strategies rather than traditionally defined functions.
        This is argued with the Reorganization of Elementary Functions (REF) framework
        as the theoretical foundation. Furthermore, it is being discussed how best
        to approach the neurocognitive research process with such a focus on strategies
        rather than functions. The use of already established “challenge” procedures
        is being referred to. Also, it is presented that novel computational methods
        are presently being developed towards even more detailed and unbiased analyses
        of behavioural/cognitive data as well as analyses of neural processes revealed

      abstract: ' Without temporal averaging, such as rate codes, it remains challenging
        to train spiking neural networks for temporal regression tasks. In this work,
        we present a novel method to accurately predict spatial coordinates from event
        data with a fully spiking convolutional neural network (SCNN) without temporal
        averaging. Our method performs on-par with artificial neural networks (ANN)
        of similar complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate faster convergence in
        half the time using translation- and scale-invariant receptive fields. To
        permit comparison with conventional frame-based ANNs, we base our results
        on a simulated event-based dataset with an unrealistic high density. Therefore,
        we hypothesize that our method significantly outperform ANNs in settings with
        lower event density, as seen in real-life event-based data. Our model is fully
        spiking and can be ported directly to neuromorphic hardware.'

      abstract: This article introduces a logic to reason about a well-known model
        of opinion dynamics in social networks initially developed by Morris DeGroot
        as well as Keith Lehrer and Carl Wagner. The proposed logic is an extension
        of Łukasiewicz' fuzzy logic with additional equational expressivity, modal
        operators, machinery from hybrid logic and dynamic modalities. The model of
        opinion dynamics in social networks is simple enough to be easily grasped,
        but still complex enough to have interesting mathematical properties and applications.
        Thus, developing a logic to reason about this particular model serves as a
        paradigmatic example of how logic can be useful in social network analysis.

        as informational cascades, in which sequential inter-agent communication might
        lead to epistemic failures at group level, despite availability of information
        that should be sufficient to track the truth. We model an example of a cascade,
        and check the correctness of the individual reasoning of each agent involved,
        using two alternative logical settings: an existing probabilistic dynamic
        epistemic logic, and our own novel logic for counting evidence. Based on this
        analysis, we conclude that cascades are not only likely to occur but are sometimes
        unavoidable by “rational” means: in some situations, the group’s inability
        to track the truth is the direct consequence of each agent’s rational attempt
        at individual truth-tracking. Moreover, our analysis shows that this is even
        so when rationality includes unbounded higher-order reasoning powers (about
        other agents’ minds and about the belief-formation-and-aggregation protocol,
        including an awareness of the very possibility of cascades), as well as when
        it includes simpler, non-Bayesian forms of heuristic reasoning (such as comparing
        the amount of evidence pieces).Social knowledge is what holds the complex
        interactions that form society together. But how reliable is social knowledge:
        how good is it at tracking the truth, in comparison with individual knowledge?
        At first sight, it may seem that groups should be better truth-trackers than
        the individuals composing them: the group can “in principle” access the information
        possessed by each agent, and in addition it can access whatever follows from

      abstract: 'Understanding protein structure is of crucial importance in science,
        medicine and biotechnology. For about two decades, knowledge-based potentials
        based on pairwise distances – so-called “potentials of mean force” (PMFs)
        – have been center stage in the prediction and design of protein structure
        and the simulation of protein folding. However, the validity, scope and limitations
        of these potentials are still vigorously debated and disputed, and the optimal
        choice of the reference state – a necessary component of these potentials
        – is an unsolved problem. PMFs are loosely justified by analogy to the reversible
        work theorem in statistical physics, or by a statistical argument based on
        a likelihood function. Both justifications are insightful but leave many questions
        unanswered. Here, we show for the first time that PMFs can be seen as approximations
        to quantities that do have a rigorous probabilistic justification: they naturally
        arise when probability distributions over different features of proteins need
        to be combined. We call these quantities “reference ratio distributions” deriving
        from the application of the “reference ratio method.” This new view is not
        only of theoretical relevance but leads to many insights that are of direct
        practical use: the reference state is uniquely defined and does not require
        external physical insights; the approach can be generalized beyond pairwise
        distances to arbitrary features of protein structure; and it becomes clear
        for which purposes the use of these quantities is justified. We illustrate
        these insights with two applications, involving the radius of gyration and

      abstract: A wide variety of model explanation approaches have been proposed
        in recent years, all guided by very different rationales and heuristics. In
        this paper, we take a new route and cast interpretability as a statistical
        inference problem. We propose a general deep probabilistic model designed
        to produce interpretable predictions. The model’s parameters can be learned
        via maximum likelihood, and the method can be adapted to any predictor network
        architecture, and any type of prediction problem. Our model is akin to amortized
        interpretability methods, where a neural network is used as a selector to
        allow for fast interpretation at inference time. Several popular interpretability
        methods are shown to be particular cases of regularized maximum likelihood
        for our general model. Using our framework, we identify imputation as a common
        issue of these models. We propose new datasets with ground truth selection
        which allow for the evaluation of the features importance map and show experimentally
        that multiple imputation provides more reasonable interpretations.

      abstract: We present a method to approximate Gaussian process regression models
        to large datasets by considering only a subset of the data. Our approach is
        novel in that the size of the subset is selected on the fly during exact inference
        with little computational overhead. From an empirical observation that the
        log-marginal likelihood often exhibits a linear trend once a sufficient subset
        of a dataset has been observed, we conclude that many large datasets contain
        redundant information that only slightly affects the posterior. Based on this,
        we provide probabilistic bounds on the full model evidence that can identify
        such subsets. Remarkably, these bounds are largely composed of terms that
        appear in intermediate steps of the standard Cholesky decomposition, allowing
        us to modify the algorithm to adaptively stop the decomposition once enough
        data have been observed.

      abstract: Convolutional neural networks are increasingly used outside the domain
        of image analysis, in particular in various areas of the natural sciences
        concerned with spatial data. Such networks often work out-of-the box, and
        in some cases entire model architectures from image analysis can be carried
        over to other problem domains almost unaltered. Unfortunately, this convenience
        does not trivially extend to data in non-euclidean spaces, such as spherical
        data. In this paper, we introduce two strategies for conducting convolutions
        on the sphere, using either a spherical-polar grid or a grid based on the
        cubed-sphere representation. We investigate the challenges that arise in this
        setting, and extend our discussion to include scenarios of spherical volumes,
        with several strategies for parameterizing the radial dimension. As a proof
        of concept, we conclude with an assessment of the performance of spherical
        convolutions in the context of molecular modelling, by considering structural
        environments within proteins. We show that the models are capable of learning
        non-trivial functions in these molecular environments, and that our spherical
        convolutions generally outperform standard 3D convolutions in this setting.
        In particular, despite the lack of any domain specific feature-engineering,
        we demonstrate performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in the field,
        which build on decades of domain-specific knowledge.

        when the training set contains missing-at-random data. Our approach, called
        MIWAE, is based on the importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE), and maximises
        a potentially tight lower bound of the log-likelihood of the observed data.
        Compared to the original IWAE, our algorithm does not induce any additional
        computational overhead due to the missing data. We also develop Monte Carlo
        techniques for single and multiple imputation using a DLVM trained on an incomplete

      abstract: 'The increasing importance of non-coding RNA in biology and medicine
        has led to a growing interest in the problem of RNA 3-D structure prediction.
        As is the case for proteins, RNA 3-D structure prediction methods require
        two key ingredients: an accurate energy function and a conformational sampling
        procedure. Both are only partly solved problems. Here, we focus on the problem
        of conformational sampling. The current state of the art solution is based
        on fragment assembly methods, which construct plausible conformations by stringing
        together short fragments obtained from experimental structures. However, the
        discrete nature of the fragments necessitates the use of carefully tuned,
        unphysical energy functions, and their non-probabilistic nature impairs unbiased
        sampling. We offer a solution to the sampling problem that removes these important
        limitations: a probabilistic model of RNA structure that allows efficient
        sampling of RNA conformations in continuous space, and with associated probabilities.
        We show that the model captures several key features of RNA structure, such
        as its rotameric nature and the distribution of the helix lengths. Furthermore,
        the model readily generates native-like 3-D conformations for 9 out of 10
        test structures, solely using coarse-grained base-pairing information. In
        conclusion, the method provides a theoretical and practical solution for a

      abstract: Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are growing in popularity. However, even
        the most current VUIs regularly cause frustration for their users. Very few
        studies exist on what people do to overcome VUI problems they encounter, or
        how VUIs can be designed to aid people when these problems occur. In this
        paper, we analyze empirical data on how users (n=12) interact with our VUI
        calendar system, DiscoverCal, over three sessions. In particular, we identify
        the main obstacle categories and types of tactics our participants employ
        to overcome them. We analyzed the patterns of how different tactics are used
        in each obstacle category. We found that while NLP Error obstacles occurred
        the most, other obstacles are more likely to frustrate or confuse the user.
        We also found patterns that suggest participants were more likely to employ
        a "guessing" approach rather than rely on visual aids or knowledge recall.

      abstract: The invisible nature of VUIs has been attributed to challenging discoverability
        with VUIs. Low discoverability often leads to learnability issues. Researchers
        have designed visual tools for VUIs to help users learn as they go. However,
        few have used adaptation to ensure that learnability with the help of these
        tools extends beyond initial use. We designed DiscoverCal, a calendar application
        designed using adaptive discovery tools to improve learnability in VUIs. In
        this paper, we identify key characteristics of existing discovery tools. We
        present our design of a VUI that adapts based on contextual relevance and

      abstract: Agency in interactive narrative is often narrowly understood as a
        user’s freedom to either perform virtually embodied actions or alter the mechanics
        of narration at will, followed by an implicit assumption of “the more agency
        the better.” This paper takes notice of a broader range of agency phenomena
        in interactive narrative and gaming that may be addressed by integrating accounts
        of agency from diverse fields such as sociology of science, digital media
        studies, philosophy, and cultural theory. The upshot is that narrative agency
        is contextually situated, distributed between the player and system, and mediated
        through user interpretation of system behavior and system affordances for
        user actions. In our new and developing model of agency play, multiple dimensions
        of agency can be tuned during story execution as a narratively situated mechanism
        to convey meaning. More importantly, we propose that this model of variable
        dimensions of agency can be used as an expressive theoretical tool for interactive
        narrative design. Finally, we present our current interactive narrative work
        under development as a case study for how the agency play model can be deployed
        expressively.

        This paper presents a curated million-image dataset, primarily to train computer-vision

      abstract: Perhaps surprisingly sewerage infrastructure is one of the most costly
        infrastructures in modern society. Sewer pipes are manually inspected to determine
        whether the pipes are defective. However, this process is limited by the number
        of qualified inspectors and the time it takes to inspect a pipe. Automatization
        of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the success of computer
        vision approaches for sewer defect classification has been limited when compared
        to the success in other fields mainly due to the lack of public datasets.
        To this end, in this work we present a large novel and publicly available
        multi-label classification dataset for image-based sewer defect classification
        called Sewer-ML. The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated
        by professional sewer inspectors from three different utility companies across
        nine years. Together with the dataset, we also present a benchmark algorithm
        and a novel metric for assessing performance. The benchmark algorithm is a
        result of evaluating 12 state-of-the-art algorithms, six from the sewer defect
        classification domain and six from the multi-label classification domain,
        and combining the best performing algorithms. The novel metric is a class-importance
        weighted F2 score, F2-CIW, reflecting the economic impact of each class, used
        together with the normal pipe F1 score, F1-Normal. The benchmark algorithm
        achieves an F2-CIW score of 55.11% and F1-Normal score of 90.94%, leaving
        ample room for improvement on the Sewer-ML dataset. The code, models, and

      abstract: Sewer pipe inspections are currently conducted by professionals who
        remotely control a robot from above ground. This expensive and slow approach
        is prone to human mistakes. Therefore, there is both an economic and scientific
        interest in automating the inspection process by creating systems able to
        recognize sewer defects. However, the extent of research put into automatic
        water level estimation in sewers has been limited despite being a prerequisite
        for further analysis of the pipe as only sections above the water level can
        be visually inspected. In this work, we utilize a dataset of still images
        obtained from over 5000 inspections carried out for three different Danish
        water utilities companies. This dataset is used for training and testing decision
        tree methods and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic water
        level estimation. We pose the estimation problem as a classification and regression
        problem, and compare the results of both approaches. Furthermore, we compare
        the effect of using different inspection standards for labeling the ground
        truth water level. By treating the problem as a classification task and using
        the 2015 Danish sewer inspection standard, where water levels are clustered
        based on visual appearance, we achieve an averaged F1 score of 79.29% using
        a fine-tuned ResNet-50 CNN. This shows the potential of using CNNs for water
        level estimation. We believe including temporal and contextual information
        will improve the results further.

      abstract: 'Many junior doctors must prepare to manage acutely ill patients in
        the emergency department. The setting is often stressful, and urgent treatment
        decisions are needed. Overlooking symptoms and making wrong choices may lead
        to substantial patient morbidity or death, and it is essential to ensure that
        junior doctors are competent. Virtual reality (VR) software can provide standardized
        and unbiased assessment, but solid validity evidence is necessary before implementation.This
        study aimed to gather validity evidence for using 360-degree VR videos with
        integrated multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to assess emergency medicine skills.Five
        full-scale emergency medicine scenarios were recorded with a 360-degree video
        camera, and MCQs were integrated into the scenarios to be played in a head-mounted
        display. We invited 3 groups of medical students with different experience
        levels to participate: first- to third-year medical students (novice group),
        last-year medical students without emergency medicine training (intermediate
        group), and last-year medical students with completed emergency medicine training
        (experienced group). Each participant’s total test score was calculated based
        on the number of correct MCQ answers (maximum score of 28), and the groups’
        mean scores were compared. The participants rated their experienced presence
        in emergency scenarios using the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) and their
        cognitive workload with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
        Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).'

      abstract: Mid-air haptic stimulation can enrich user experience during human-computer
        interaction. However, the design space of such stimuli is large due to the
        number and range of stimulation parameters. It therefore remains difficult
        for designers to select a stimulus to induce an intended experience. We derive
        a mapping for mid-air experiences based on two user studies. In the first
        study, participants rated 36 stimuli varied across three parameters (frequency,
        pattern, and repetitions). These ratings allowed us to determine a set of
        five experientially distinct stimuli. In the second study, participants vocalized
        their experiences with those five stimuli. This allows us to generate a mapping
        of 17 sensations and 23 experiences related to the stimuli. Finally, we discuss
        how the mapping can inform designers and researchers working with mid-air
        haptic technologies.

      abstract: Transfer functions with a high translational gain can increase the
        range of walking in virtual reality. These functions determine how much virtual
        movements are amplified compared to the corresponding physical movements.
        However, it is unclear how the design of these functions influences the user’s
        gait and experience when walking with high gain values. In a mixed-methods
        study with 20 users, we find that their best transfer functions are nonlinear
        and asymmetrical for starting and stopping. We use an optimization approach
        to determine individually optimized functions that are significantly better
        than a common approach of using a constant gain. Based on interviews, we also
        discuss what qualities of walking matter to users and how these vary across
        different functions. Our work shows that it is possible to create high-gain
        walking techniques that offer dramatically increased range of motion and speed

      abstract: The human skin provides an ample, always-on surface for input to smart
        watches, mobile phones, and remote displays. Using touch on bare skin to issue
        commands, however, requires users to recall the location of items without
        direct visual feedback. We present an in-depth study in which participants
        placed 30 items on the hand and forearm and attempted to recall their locations.
        We found that participants used a variety of landmarks, personal associations,
        and semantic groupings in placing the items on the skin. Although participants
        most frequently used anatomical landmarks (e.g., fingers, joints, and nails),
        recall rates were higher for items placed on personal landmarks, including
        scars and tattoos. We further found that personal associations between items
        improved recall, and that participants often grouped important items in similar
        areas, such as family members on the nails. We conclude by discussing the

        illusion that can make physical objects seem larger or smaller. We present
        a discrimination experiment to estimate the thresholds of resizing virtual
        objects from physical objects, without the user reliably noticing a difference.
        The results show that the size difference is easily detected when a physical
        object is used to represent an object less than 90% of its size. When physical
        objects represent larger virtual objects, however, then scaling is tightly

      abstract: 'Mathematical morphology (MM) is an indispensable tool for post-processing.
        Several extensions of MM to categorical images, such as multi-class segmentations,
        have been proposed. However, none provide satisfactory definitions for morphology
        on probabilistic representations of categorical images. The categorical distribution
        is a natural choice for representing uncertainty about categorical images.
        Extending MM to categorical distributions is problematic because categories
        are inherently unordered. Without ranking categories, we cannot use the standard
        framework based on supremum and infimum. Ranking categories is impractical
        and problematic. Instead, we consider the probabilistic representation and

      abstract: Physics-based animation is becoming increasingly popular due to its
        use in computer games, for producing special effects in movies, and as part
        of surgical simulation systems. Over the past decade the field has matured,
        and today there is a wealth of simulation methods solving many simulation
        problems. There is a vast amount of examples where physics-based animation
        is used, eg, rigid bodies stumbling around (The Hulk R©, Grand Turismo R©,
        Medal of Honor R©, Half-Life R©); skin and muscle deformations (Shrek R©,
        the Nutty Professor R©, Jurassic Park R©, the Mummy R©); water splashing (Shrek
        R©, Titanic R©, Finding Nemo R©); jelly blobs dancing around (Flopper R©);
        death-like animations (Hitman R©); hair blowing in the wind or bending due
        to motion of a character (Monsters Inc R©); cloth moving (Monsters Inc R©);
        and melting robots and cyborg parts of characters (Terminator3 R©, Treasure
        Island R©), just to mention a few. There is an ongoing quest for exploiting
        physics-based animation. While it was a computationally heavy burden 10–20
        years ago to kinetically animate a linked character consisting of no more
        than a handful of limbs [Wellman, 1993], today this is considered a trivial
        task due to the large increase of computer power. The increase of computer
        power allows us to simulate increasingly complex scenarios, in an apparently
        never-ending spiral, and it appears that there will always be a demand for
        faster methods, with more details, larger scenes, etc. Nevertheless, a major
        part of such animations will always be a physical model of the world constructed

      abstract: Studying the dynamics of sperm tail beating in 3D is important for
        understanding decreasing fertility trends related to motility. Synchrotron
        X-ray tomography (SXRT) shows promising results for imaging live biological
        samples in 3D and time, making it a candidate for imaging sperm tail beating
        patterns. However, the dose of ionizing radiation (IR) that the cells would
        receive during image acquisition is of concern as this is likely to affect
        essential cellular functions. The effect of IR on motility at the dose rates
        encountered in a synchrotron has never been assessed. Here, results are presented
        of analyzing the movement and viability of sperm cells exposed at varying
        durations at the TOMCAT beamline (Swiss Light Source (SLS)) which has the
        field of view and spatial resolution needed to reconstruct sperm cells coupled
        with sub-second exposure times. The results indicate that motility is affected
        long before viability and that sperm cell dynamics are affected very quickly
        by the beam.

      abstract: Fast phase-contrast imaging offered by modern synchrotron facilities
        opens the possibility of imaging dynamic processes of biological material
        such as cells. Cells are mainly composed of carbon and hydrogen, which have
        low X-ray attenuation, making cell studies with X-ray tomography challenging.
        At specific low energies, cells provide contrast, but cryo-conditions are
        required to protect the sample from radiation damage. Thus, non-toxic labelling
        methods are needed to prepare living cells for X-ray tomography at higher
        energies. We propose using iron oxide nanoparticles due to their proven compatibility
        in other biomedical applications. We show how to synthesize and attach iron
        oxide nanoparticles and demonstrate that cell-penetrating peptides facilitate
        iron oxide nanoparticle uptake into sperm cells. We show results from the
        TOMCAT Nanoscope (Swiss Light Source), showing that iron oxide nanoparticles
        allow the heads and midpiece of fixed sperm samples to be reconstructed from
        X-ray projections taken at 10 keV.

        Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that WT hGPCs acquired a YAP1/MYC/E2F-defined
        dominant competitor phenotype upon interaction with the host HD glia. WT hGPCs
        also outcompeted older resident isogenic WT cells that had been transplanted

      abstract: This paper presents a method for airway tree segmentation that uses
        a combination of a trained airway appearance model, vessel and airway orientation
        information, and region growing. We propose a voxel classification approach
        for the appearance model, which uses a classifier that is trained to differentiate
        between airway and non-airway voxels. This is in contrast to previous works
        that use either intensity alone or hand crafted models of airway appearance.
        We show that the appearance model can be trained with a set of easily acquired,
        incomplete, airway tree segmentations. A vessel orientation similarity measure
        is introduced, which indicates how similar the orientation of an airway candidate
        is to the orientation of the neighboring vessel. We use this vessel orientation
        similarity measure to overcome regions in the airway tree that have a low
        response from the appearance model. The proposed method is …

      abstract: Contextual bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms have been
        successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as online advertising,
        recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they have yet to be widely
        adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare. One reason
        may be that existing approaches assume that the underlying mechanisms are
        static in the sense that they do not change over different environments. In
        many real-world systems, however, the mechanisms are subject to shifts across
        environments which may invalidate the static environment assumption. In this
        paper, we take a step toward tackling the problem of environmental shifts
        considering the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the environmental
        shift problem through the lens of causality and propose multi-environment
        contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying …

      abstract: Conditional independence testing is an important problem, especially
        in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Due to the curse of dimensionality,
        testing for conditional independence of continuous variables is particularly
        challenging. We propose a Kernel-based Conditional Independence test (KCI-test),
        by constructing an appropriate test statistic and deriving its asymptotic
        distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence. The proposed
        method is computationally efficient and easy to implement. Experimental results
        show that it outperforms other methods, especially when the conditioning set
        is large or the sample size is not very large, in which case other methods
        encounter difficulties.

      abstract: Policy learning is an important component of many real-world learning
        systems. A major challenge in policy learning is how to adapt efficiently
        to unseen environments or tasks. Recently, it has been suggested to exploit
        invariant conditional distributions to learn models that generalize better
        to unseen environments. However, assuming invariance of entire conditional
        distributions (which we call full invariance) may be too strong of an assumption
        in practice. In this paper, we introduce a relaxation of full invariance called
        effect-invariance (e-invariance for short) and prove that it is sufficient,
        under suitable assumptions, for zero-shot policy generalization. We also discuss
        an extension that exploits e-invariance when we have a small sample from the
        test environment, enabling few-shot policy generalization. Our work does not
        assume an underlying causal graph or that the data are generated by a structural
        causal model; instead, we develop testing procedures to test e-invariance
        directly from data. We present empirical results using simulated data and
        a mobile health intervention dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
        approach.

      abstract: The discovery of causal relationships between a set of observed variables
        is a fundamental problem in science. For continuous-valued data linear acyclic
        causal models are often used because these models are well understood and
        there are well-known methods to fit them to data. In reality, of course, many
        causal relationships are more or less nonlinear, raising some doubts as to
        the applicability and usefulness of purely linear methods. In this contribution
        we show that in fact the basic linear framework can be generalized to nonlinear
        models with additive noise. In this extended framework, nonlinearities in
        the data-generating process are in fact a blessing rather than a curse, as
        they typically provide information on the underlying causal system and allow
        more aspects of the true data-generating mechanisms to be identified. In addition
        to theoretical results we show simulations and some simple real data experiments
        illustrating the identification power provided by nonlinearities.

        important in data science and machine learning.The mathematization of causality
        is a relatively recent development, and has become increasingly important
        in data science and machine learning. This book offers a self-contained and
        concise introduction to causal models and how to learn them from data. After
        explaining the need for causal models and discussing some of the principles
        underlying causal inference, the book teaches readers how to use causal models:
        how to compute intervention distributions, how to infer causal models from
        observational and interventional data, and how causal ideas could be exploited
        for classical machine learning problems. All of these topics are discussed
        first in terms of two variables and then in the more general multivariate
        case. The bivariate case turns out to be a particularly hard problem for causal
        learning because there are no conditional independences as used by classical
        methods for solving multivariate cases. The authors consider analyzing statistical
        asymmetries between cause and effect to be highly instructive, and they report
        on their decade of intensive research into this problem. The book is accessible
        to readers with a background in machine learning or statistics, and can be
        used in graduate courses or as a reference for researchers. The text includes
        code snippets that can be copied and pasted, exercises, and an appendix with
        a summary of the most important technical concepts.'

      abstract: Humans collaborate in different contexts such as in creative or scientific
        projects, in workplaces and in sports. Depending on the project and external
        circumstances, a newly formed collaboration may include people that have collaborated
        before in the past, and people with no collaboration history. Such existing
        relationships between team members have been reported to influence the performance
        of teams. However, it is not clear how existing relationships between team
        members should be quantified, and whether some relationships are more likely
        to occur in new collaborations than others. Here we introduce a new family
        of structural patterns, m-patterns, which formalize relationships between
        collaborators and we study the prevalence of such structures in data and a
        simple random-hypergraph null model. We analyze the frequency with which different
        collaboration structures appear in our null model and show how such frequencies
        depend on size and hyperedge density in the hypergraphs. Comparing the null
        model to data of human and non-human collaborations, we find that some collaboration
        structures are vastly under- and overrepresented in empirical datasets. Finally,
        we find that structures of scientific collaborations on COVID-19 papers in
        some cases are statistically significantly different from those of non-COVID-19
        papers. Examining citation counts for 4 different scientific fields, we also
        find indications that repeat collaborations are more successful for 2-author
        scientific publications and less successful for 3-author scientific publications
        as compared to other collaboration structures.

        from peer to peer. Examples include communicable diseases, rumors, misinformation,
        ideas, innovations, bank failures, and electrical blackouts. Sometimes, as
        in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, a contagion mutates at some point as it
        spreads through a network. Here, using a simple susceptible-infected model
        of contagion, we explore the downstream impact of a single mutation event.
        Assuming that this mutation occurs at a random node in the contact network,
        we calculate the distribution of the number of “descendants,” d, downstream
        from the initial “patient zero” mutant. We find that the tail of the distribution
        decays as d− 2 for complete graphs, random graphs, small-world networks, networks
        with block-like structure, and other infinite-dimensional networks. This prediction

        efficiency (number of prevented infections per isolation). Two important strategies

        the growth of disruptive technologies research in public administration over
        time, especially in the last decade, as accelerated by several of the most
        relevant documents published in reputable journals such as Government Information
        Quarterly, Sustainable Cities and Society and Sustainability by several prominent
        authors. Most research has been conducted in the United States, followed by
        the United Kingdom and China and focused especially on artificial intelligence,
        followed by the internet of things, social media and blockchain, with the
        smart city being an important concept in disruptive technologies research
        in public administration. Finally, the results suggest that different public
        administration areas have different implications for disruptive technologies.
        The findings may be of benefit to not only the scientific community to serve
        as an important source for detecting associated research gaps but also to
        evidence-based policymaking to fully address the issues related to disruptive
        technologies in public administration in the future.

      abstract: Increasingly advanced medicines have created monopolies in treatment
        areas with no viable options for generic substitution due to patent protection.
        As health care systems are increasingly under pressure to deliver health care
        improvements, costs become prohibitive as budgets are under pressure. To create
        financial flexibility, Danish regional authorities have over the period from
        2009 until today developed, implemented, and gradually increased the use of
        a new model for analogue medicine substitution. The model introduces competitive
        tenders among patented medicines by declaring these medicines therapeutically
        equivalent in the treatment of specific diseases and thereby creating new
        opportunities for reducing annual medicine expenses. The model is based on
        enhanced collaboration among the health technology assessment (HTA) body,
        the procurement body, and the hospital owner, and it effectively …

        and the platform (i.e., core), little is known about how self-reorganizations
        influence complementor participation and engagement. In this study, we investigate

      abstract: Blockchain systems allow for securely keeping shared records of transactions
        in a decentralised way. This is enabled by algorithms called consensus mechanisms.
        Proof-of-work is the most prominent consensus mechanism, but environmentally
        unsustainable. Here, we focus on proof-of-stake, its best-known alternative.
        Importantly, decentralised decision-making power is not an inherent feature
        of blockchain systems, but a technological possibility. Numerous security
        incidents illustrate that decentralised control cannot be taken for granted.
        We therefore study how key parameters affect the degree of decentralisation
        in proof-of-stake blockchain systems. Based on a real-world implementation
        of a proof-of-stake blockchain system, we conduct agent-based simulations
        to study how a range of parameters impact decentralisation. The results suggest
        that high numbers of initial potential validator nodes, large …

      abstract: 'Digital infrastructures play an increasingly central role in shaping
        existing organisations and creating new ones. Research on digital infrastructure
        has rested on the assumption that infrastructures are developed to support
        pre-existing organised activities. However, with new digital infrastructures
        supporting open source projects and blockchain communities such as Bitcoin,
        development of the technological infrastructure also gives rise to a new way
        of self-organising. Specifically, forking of the underlying source code and
        subsequent community adoption is increasingly observed to trigger new patterns
        of self-organising. In order to explore and develop this concept, this paper
        investigates a case of such distributed digital community: the emergence of
        the Bitcoin community around a specific instantiation of the Blockchain infrastructure.
        Our study examines how the community emerges, and how changes in the source

        forking influence participation in the development, validation, transaction,
        and complementor networks. We find that, while participation increases across
        all networks show a small increase after hard forking events, more complex
        dynamics are at play within each network that builds on delicate trade-offs
        between participation structure, configuration, and incentives. Our findings

      abstract: Given the ubiquity of digital technologies, and increased use of autonomous
        algorithms, it is likely that many of today’s social and organizational processes
        will one day include autonomous elements. The Bitcoin blockchain is likely
        the first case of an increasingly generative and autonomous way of organizing,
        and the specific properties of blockchain infrastructures—distribution of
        control, openness to manipulation, and generativity of the underlying source
        code—make it an ideal case to study patterns of self-organizing. This paper
        investigates the phenomenon of self-organizing through a study of forking
        in the Bitcoin blockchain infrastructure between 2010 and 2016. It adds to
        the emerging body of research on digital infrastructures, and particularly
        blockchain infrastructures, by conceptualizing forking as a pattern of self-organizing
        in blockchain infrastructures that specifically involves the underlying infrastructure,
        the scale of code changes, individual objectives, and collective adoption,
        whether specific or general. Thus, this paper demonstrates how forking in
        blockchain infrastructures mediates between divergent organizing objectives
        and existing capabilities, on the one hand, and generates self-organizing
        on the other hand. In this paper, we further contextualize our findings in
        extant work on digital infrastructures, offer a guide for designers of blockchain
        infrastructures, and propose the concept of “generative mirroring” as a pattern
        through which blockchain infrastructures and organizing adaptively coevolve.

      abstract: For many years cooperative design was primarily concerned with the
        development of IT supported systems for professional users. However, the cooperative
        design approach can embrace other social practices such as children’s everyday
        life. At a methodological level there is no difference in designing with adults
        or children. However there is a need for new methods to support communication
        and collaboration between designers and children. This article proposes a
        new method for understandings children’s appropriation of new technology in
        an interactive workshop setting. The method, which we call the Networking
        News workshop, offers an opportunity to make first hand studies of children’s
        IT supported social activities in an informal classroom setting.

      abstract: 'While polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard to quantify sleep,
        modern technology allows for new alternatives. PSG is obtrusive, affects the
        sleep it is set out to measure and requires technical assistance for mounting.
        A number of less obtrusive solutions based on alternative methods have been
        introduced, but few have been clinically validated. Here we validate one of
        these solutions, the ear-EEG method, against concurrently recorded PSG in
        twenty healthy subjects each measured for four nights. Two trained technicians
        scored the 80 nights of PSG independently, while an automatic algorithm scored
        the ear-EEG. The sleep stages and eight sleep metrics (Total Sleep Time (TST),
        Sleep Onset Latency, Sleep Efficiency, Wake After Sleep Onset, REM latency,
        REM fraction of TST, N2 fraction of TST, and N3 fraction of TST) were used
        in the further analysis. We found the sleep metrics: Total Sleep Time, Sleep
        Onset Latency, Sleep Efficiency, Wake After Sleep Onset were estimated with
        high accuracy and precision between automatic sleep scoring and manual sleep
        scoring. However, the REM latency and REM fraction of sleep showed high accuracy
        but low precision. Further, the automatic sleep scoring systematically overestimated
        the N2 fraction of sleep and slightly underestimated the N3 fraction of sleep.
        We demonstrate that sleep metrics estimated from automatic sleep scoring based
        on repeated ear-EEG in some cases are more reliably estimated with repeated
        nights of automatically scored ear-EEG than with a single night of manually

        Today, the only widely accepted method for clinically monitoring sleep is
        the polysomnography (PSG), which is, however, both expensive to perform and
        influences the sleep. This has led to investigations into light weight electroencephalography
        (EEG) alternatives. However, there has been a substantial performance gap
        between proposed alternatives and PSG. Here we show results from an extensive
        study of 80 full night recordings of healthy participants wearing both PSG
        equipment and ear-EEG. We obtain automatic sleep scoring with an accuracy
        close to that achieved by manual scoring of scalp EEG (the current gold standard),
        using only ear-EEG as input, attaining an average Cohen’s kappa of 0.73. In

        staging is by visual analysis of polysomnography (PSG), which is expensive
        and time consuming. Here, we investigate automated sleep scoring based on
        a low‐cost, mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) platform consisting of a lightweight

        the ear, which can be implemented as a fully self‐applicable sleep system.
        However, cEEGrid signals have different amplitude characteristics to normal
        scalp PSG signals, which might be challenging for visual scoring. Therefore,
        this study evaluates the potential of automatic scoring of cEEGrid signals
        using a machine learning classifier (“random forests”) and compares its performance
        with manual scoring of standard PSG. In addition, the automatic …

      abstract: Sleep and sleep quality assessment by means of sleep stage analysis
        is important for both scientific and clinical applications. Unfortunately,
        the presently preferred method, polysomnography (PSG), requires considerable
        expert assistance and significantly affects the sleep of the person under
        observation. A reliable, accurate and mobile alternative to the PSG would
        make sleep information much more readily available in a wide range of medical
        circumstances. Using an already proven method, ear-EEG, in which electrodes
        are placed inside the concha and ear canal, we measure cerebral activity and
        automatically score the sleep into up to five stages. These results are compared
        to manual scoring by trained clinicians, based on a simultaneously recorded
        PSG. The correspondence between manually scored sleep, based on the PSG, and
        the automatic labelling, based on ear-EEG data, was evaluated using Cohen’s
        kappa coefficient. Kappa values are in the range 0.5–0.8, making ear-EEG relevant
        for both scientific and clinical applications. Furthermore, a sleep-wake classifier
        with leave-one-out cross validation yielded specificity of 0.94 and sensitivity
        of 0.52 for the sleep stage. Ear-EEG based scoring has clear advantages when
        compared to both the PSG and other mobile solutions, such as actigraphs. It
        is far more mobile, and potentially cheaper than the PSG, and the information
        on sleep stages is far superior to a wrist-based actigraph, or other devices
        based solely on body movement. This study shows that ear-EEG recordings carry
        information about sleep stages, and indicates that automatic sleep staging
        based on ear-EEG can classify …

      abstract: Human sleep is cyclical with a period of approximately 90 minutes,
        implying long temporal dependency in the sleep data. Yet, exploring this long-term
        dependency when developing sleep staging models has remained untouched. In
        this work, we show that while encoding the logic of a whole sleep cycle is
        crucial to improve sleep staging performance, the sequential modelling approach
        in existing state-of-the-art deep learning models are inefficient for that
        purpose. We thus introduce a method for efficient long sequence modelling

        whole-cycle sleep information for sleep staging. Evaluating L-SeqSleepNet

        recording of EEG in natural environments. The objective of this study was
        to substantiate the ear-EEG method by using a larger population of subjects
        and several paradigms. For rigor, we considered simultaneous scalp and ear-EEG
        recordings with common reference. More precisely, 32 conventional scalp electrodes
        and 12 ear electrodes allowed a thorough comparison between conventional and
        ear electrodes, testing several different placements of references. The paradigms
        probed auditory onset response, mismatch negativity, auditory steady-state
        response and alpha power attenuation. By comparing event related potential
        (ERP) waveforms from the mismatch response paradigm, the signal measured from
        the ear electrodes was found to reflect the same cortical activity as that
        from nearby scalp electrodes. It was also found that referencing the ear-EEG
        electrodes to another within-ear electrode affects the time-domain recorded
        waveform (relative to scalp recordings), but not the timing of individual
        components. It was furthermore found that auditory steady-state responses
        and alpha-band modulation were measured reliably with the ear-EEG modality.

        healthy subjects were recruited for a 12-night sleep study. The study was
        divided into two parts; part A comprised two nights with both ear-EEG and
        polysomnography (PSG), and part B comprised 10 nights using only ear-EEG.
        In addition to the electrophysiological measurements, subjects filled out
        a questionnaire after each night of sleep. The subjects reported that the
        ear-EEG system was easy to use, and that the comfort was better in part B.
        The performance of the system was validated by comparing automatic sleep scoring
        based on ear-EEG with PSG-based sleep scoring performed by a professional
        trained sleep scorer. Cohen’s kappa was used to assess the agreement between
        the manual and automatic sleep scorings, and the study showed an average kappa
        value of 0.71. The majority of the 20 recordings from part A yielded a kappa
        value above 0.7. The study was compared to a companioned study conducted with
        individualized earpieces. To compare the sleep across the two studies and
        two parts, 7 different sleeps metrics were calculated based on the automatic
        sleep scorings. The ear-EEG nights were validated through linear mixed model
        analysis in which the effects of equipment (individualized vs generic earpieces),
        part (PSG and ear-EEG vs only ear-EEG) and subject were investigated. We found
        that the subject effect was …

      abstract: Masked image modeling has been demonstrated as a powerful pretext
        task for generating robust representations that can be effectively generalized
        across multiple downstream tasks. Typically, this approach involves randomly
        masking patches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining
        unchanged during training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning
        approach that updates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity
        of the self-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually
        increasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and
        transferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel learnable
        masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of different
        complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked autoencoders (MAE).
        Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting its behavior during
        training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE (optimizing the same reconstruction
        loss) to an adversary (optimizing the opposite loss), while passing through
        a neutral state. The transition between these behaviors is smooth, being regulated
        by a factor that is multiplied with the reconstruction loss of the masking
        module. The resulting training procedure generates an easy-to-hard curriculum.
        We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked Autoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and
        show that it exhibits superior representation learning capabilities compared
        to MAE. The empirical results on five downstream tasks confirm our conjecture,
        demonstrating that curriculum learning can be successfully used to self-supervise
        masked …

      abstract: Innovation has formed much of the rich history in biometrics. The
        field of soft biometrics was originally aimed to augment the recognition process
        by fusion of metrics that were sufficient to discriminate populations rather
        than individuals. This was later refined to use measures that could be used
        to discriminate individuals, especially using descriptions that can be perceived
        using human vision and in surveillance imagery. A further branch of this new
        field concerns approaches to estimate soft biometrics, either using conventional
        biometrics approaches or just from images alone. These three strands combine
        to form what is now known as soft biometrics. We survey the achievements that
        have been made in recognition by and in estimation of these parameters, describing
        how these approaches can be used and where they might lead to. The approaches
        lead to a new type of recognition, and one similar to Bertillonage …

      abstract: Pain is an unpleasant feeling that has been shown to be an important
        factor for the recovery of patients. Since this is costly in human resources
        and difficult to do objectively, there is the need for automatic systems to
        measure it. In this paper, contrary to current state-of-the-art techniques
        in pain assessment, which are based on facial features only, we suggest that
        the performance can be enhanced by feeding the raw frames to deep learning
        models, outperforming the latest state-of-the-art results while also directly
        facing the problem of imbalanced data. As a baseline, our approach first uses
        convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn facial features from VGG_Faces,
        which are then linked to a long short-term memory to exploit the temporal
        relation between video frames. We further compare the performances of using
        the so popular schema based on the canonically normalized appearance versus

      abstract: The goal of Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is to reconstruct
        a High-Resolution (HR) version of a degraded Low-Resolution (LR) image. Existing
        Super-Resolution (SR) methods mostly assume that the LR image is a result
        of blurring and downsampling the HR image, while in reality LR images are
        often degraded by additional factors such as low-light, low-contrast, noise,
        and color distortion. Due to this, current State-of-the-Art (SoTA) SR methods
        cannot reconstruct real low-light low-resolution images, and a straightforward
        strategy is, therefore, to first perform Low-Light Enhancement (LLE), followed
        by SR, using dedicated methods for each task. Unfortunately, this approach
        leads to poor performance, which motivates us to propose a method for joint
        LLE and SR. However, since LLE and SR are both ill-posed and ill-conditioned

        anomaly detection was recently introduced in literature. Due to its highly
        accurate results, the method attracted the attention of many researchers.
        In this work, we revisit the self-supervised multi-task learning framework,

        of vision transformers. As such, we alternatively introduce both 2D and 3D

      abstract: ' This work focuses on achieving a weather-agnostic approach for the
        real-world deployment of object recognition algorithms. Particularly object
        recognition conducted on thermal data exposed to long-term thermal drift.
        Deployments of real-world object detection systems often experience a degradation
        in performance over time due to concept drift. Systems that leverage thermal
        cameras are especially susceptible because the respective thermal signatures
        of objects and their surroundings are highly sensitive to environmental changes.
        In this study, two types of weather-aware latent conditioning methods are
        investigated. The proposed method aims to guide two object detectors, (YOLOv5
        and Deformable DETR) to become weather-aware. This is achieved by leveraging
        an auxiliary branch that predicts weather-related information while conditioning
        intermediate layers of the object detector. While the conditioning methods
        proposed do not directly improve the accuracy of baseline detectors, it can
        be observed that conditioned networks manage to extract a weather-related
        signal from the thermal images, thus resulting in a decreased miss rate at
        the cost of increased false positives. The extracted signal appears noisy
        and is thus challenging to regress accurately. This is most likely a result
        of the qualitative nature of the thermal sensor; thus, further work is needed
        to identify an ideal method for optimizing the conditioning branch, as well
        as to further improve the accuracy of the system.'

      abstract: How to measure usability is an important question in HCI research
        and user interface evaluation. We review current practice in measuring usability
        by categorizing and discussing usability measures from 180 studies published
        in core HCI journals and proceedings. The discussion distinguish several problems
        with the measures, including whether they actually measure usability, if they
        cover usability broadly, how they are reasoned about, and if they meet recommendations
        on how to measure usability. In many studies, the choice of and reasoning
        about usability measures fall short of a valid and reliable account of usability
        as quality-in-use of the user interface being studied. Based on the review,
        we discuss challenges for studies of usability and for research into how to
        measure usability. The challenges are to distinguish and empirically compare
        subjective and objective measures of usability; to focus on …

      abstract: Determining the optimal sample complexity of PAC learning in the realizable
        setting was a central open problem in learning theory for decades. Finally,
        the seminal work by Hanneke (2016) gave an algorithm with a provably optimal
        sample complexity. His algorithm is based on a careful and structured sub-sampling
        of the training data and then returning a majority vote among hypotheses trained
        on each of the sub-samples. While being a very exciting theoretical result,
        it has not had much impact in practice, in part due to inefficiency, since
        it constructs a polynomial number of sub-samples of the training data, each
        of linear size. In this work, we prove the surprising result that the practical
        and classic heuristic\emph {bagging}(aka bootstrap aggregation), due to Breiman
        (1996), is in fact also an optimal PAC learner. Bagging pre-dates Hanneke’s
        algorithm by twenty years and is taught in most undergraduate machine learning
        courses. Moreover, we show that it only requires a logarithmic number of sub-samples
        to reach optimality.

      abstract: Computing a shortest path between two nodes in an undirected unweighted
        graph is among the most basic algorithmic tasks. Breadth first search solves
        this problem in linear time, which is clearly also a lower bound in the worst
        case. However, several works have shown how to solve this problem in sublinear
        time in expectation when the input graph is drawn from one of several classes
        of random graphs. In this work, we extend these results by giving sublinear
        time shortest path (and short path) algorithms for expander graphs. We thus
        identify a natural deterministic property of a graph (that is satisfied by
        typical random regular graphs) which suffices for sublinear time shortest
        paths. The algorithms are very simple, involving only bidirectional breadth
        first search and short random walks. We also complement our new algorithms
        by near-matching lower bounds.

        is a (possibly randomized) RAM, for which the memory access pattern reveals
        no information about the operations performed. The main performance metric
        of an ORAM is the bandwidth overhead, i.e., the multiplicative factor extra
        memory blocks that must be accessed to hide the operation sequence. In their
        seminal paper introducing the ORAM, Goldreich and Ostrovsky proved an amortized    bandwidth
        overhead lower bound for ORAMs with memory size n. Their lower bound is very

        top-k items in a universe of size n using the same asymptotic O(k log n) words
        of memory and O(log n) update time as the COUNTMIN and COUNTSKETCH, but requiring

        from the heavy hitters problem to a clustering problem in which each heavy
        hitter is encoded as some form of noisy spectral cluster in a graph, and the

        a cornerstone result in dimensionality reduction, stating it is possible to
        embed a set of  points in -dimensional Euclidean space into optimal  dimensions,
        while preserving all pairwise distances to within a factor . The seminal Fast
        Johnson-Lindenstrauss (Fast JL) transform by Ailon and Chazelle (SICOMP’09)
        supports computing the embedding of a data point in  time, where the  term
        comes from multiplication with a  Hadamard matrix and the  term comes from
        multiplication with a sparse  matrix. Despite the Fast JL transform being
        more than a decade old, it is one of the fastest dimensionality reduction
        techniques for many tradeoffs between  and . In this work, we give a surprising
        new analysis of the Fast JL transform, showing that the  term in the embedding
        time can be improved to  for an . The improvement follows by using an even
        sparser matrix. We complement our improved analysis with a lower bound showing

        onto span(X)). Previously such a lower bound was only known to hold against

      abstract: Users are the last line of defense as phishing emails pass filter
        mechanisms. At the same time, phishing emails are designed so that they are
        challenging to identify by users. To this end, attackers employ techniques,
        such as eliciting stress, targeting helpfulness, or exercising authority,
        due to which users often miss being manipulated out of malicious intent. This
        work builds on the assumption that manipulation techniques, even if going
        unnoticed by users, still lead to changes in their behavior. In this work,
        we present the outcomes of an online study in which we collected gaze and

        emails lead to significant differences across behavioral features but depend

        and spontaneous digital commands -- such as to play a music track, check notifications

        hand opening to summon the menu UI, eye-hand input for selection of items,

        many interactions, the eyes naturally point at objects of interest while the

        for virtual reality, the Gaze + Pinch interaction technique. It integrates
        eye gaze to select targets, and indirect freehand gestures to manipulate them.
        This keeps the gesture use intuitive like direct physical manipulation, but
        the gesture's effect can be applied to any object the user looks at --- whether
        located near or far. In this paper, we describe novel interaction concepts

      abstract: Eye gaze is a compelling interaction modality but requires user calibration
        before interaction can commence. State of the art procedures require the user
        to fixate on a succession of calibration markers, a task that is often experienced
        as difficult and tedious. We present pursuit calibration, a novel approach
        that, unlike existing methods, is able to detect the user's attention to a
        calibration target. This is achieved by using moving targets, and correlation
        of eye movement and target trajectory, implicitly exploiting smooth pursuit
        eye movement. Data for calibration is then only sampled when the user is attending
        to the target. Because of its ability to detect user attention, pursuit calibration
        can be performed implicitly, which enables more flexible designs of the calibration
        task. We demonstrate this in application examples and user studies, and show
        that pursuit calibration is tolerant to interruption, can blend naturally

      abstract: In design work, a common task is the interaction with menus to change
        the drawing mode. Done frequently, this can become a tedious and fatiguing
        task, especially for tablets where users physically employ a stylus or finger
        touch. As our eyes are naturally involved in visual search and acquisition
        of desired menu items, we propose gaze to shortcut the physical movement.
        We investigate gaze-based mode-switching for menus in tablets by a novel mode-switching
        methodology, assessing a gaze-only (dwell-time) and multimodal (gaze and tap)
        technique, compared to hand-based interaction. The results suggest that users
        can efficiently alternate between manual and eye input when interacting with
        the menu; both gaze-based techniques have lower physical demand and individual
        speed-error trade-offs. This led to a novel technique that substantially reduces
        time by unifying mode-selection and mode-application …

      abstract: Physics-based animation is becoming increasingly popular due to its
        use in computer games, for producing special effects in movies, and as part
        of surgical simulation systems. Over the past decade the field has matured,
        and today there is a wealth of simulation methods solving many simulation
        problems. There is a vast amount of examples where physics-based animation
        is used, eg, rigid bodies stumbling around (The Hulk R©, Grand Turismo R©,
        Medal of Honor R©, Half-Life R©); skin and muscle deformations (Shrek R©,
        the Nutty Professor R©, Jurassic Park R©, the Mummy R©); water splashing (Shrek
        R©, Titanic R©, Finding Nemo R©); jelly blobs dancing around (Flopper R©);
        death-like animations (Hitman R©); hair blowing in the wind or bending due
        to motion of a character (Monsters Inc R©); cloth moving (Monsters Inc R©);
        and melting robots and cyborg parts of characters (Terminator3 R©, Treasure
        Island R©), just to mention a few. There is an ongoing quest for exploiting
        physics-based animation. While it was a computationally heavy burden 10–20
        years ago to kinetically animate a linked character consisting of no more
        than a handful of limbs [Wellman, 1993], today this is considered a trivial
        task due to the large increase of computer power. The increase of computer
        power allows us to simulate increasingly complex scenarios, in an apparently
        never-ending spiral, and it appears that there will always be a demand for
        faster methods, with more details, larger scenes, etc. Nevertheless, a major
        part of such animations will always be a physical model of the world constructed
        from the laws of physics and solved numerically. A major …

      abstract: Topological changes like sliding motion, sources and sinks are a significant
        challenge in image registration. This work proposes the use of the alternating
        direction method of multipliers as a general framework for constraining the
        registration of separate objects with individual deformation fields from overlapping
        in image registration. This constraint is enforced by introducing a collision
        detection algorithm from the field of computer graphics which results in a
        robust divide and conquer optimization strategy using Free-Form Deformations.
        A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework performs superior
        with regards to the combination of intersection prevention and image registration
        including synthetic examples containing complex displacement patterns. The
        results show compliance with the non-intersection constraints while simultaneously
        preventing a decrease in registration accuracy. Furthermore, the application
        of the proposed algorithm to the DIR-Lab data set demonstrates that the framework
        generalizes to real data by validating it on a lung registration problem.

      abstract: In this paper, we present a method for animating multiphase flow of
        immiscible fluids using unstructured moving meshes. Our underlying discretization
        is an unstructured tetrahedral mesh, the deformable simplicial complex (DSC),
        that moves with the flow in a Lagrangian manner. Mesh optimization operations
        improve element quality and avoid element inversion. In the context of multiphase
        flow, we guarantee that every element is occupied by a single fluid and, consequently,
        the interface between fluids is represented by a set of faces in the simplicial
        complex. This approach ensures that the underlying discretization matches
        the physics and avoids the additional book-keeping required in grid-based
        methods where multiple fluids may occupy the same cell. Our Lagrangian approach
        naturally leads us to adopt a finite element approach to simulation, in contrast

      abstract: Accurate analysis and modeling of renal functions require a precise
        segmentation of the renal blood vessels. Micro-CT scans provide image data
        at higher resolutions, making more small vessels near the renal cortex visible.
        Although deep-learning-based methods have shown state-of-the-art performance
        in automatic blood vessel segmentations, they require a large amount of labeled
        training data. However, voxel-wise labeling in micro-CT scans is extremely
        time-consuming given the huge volume sizes. To mitigate the problem, we simulate
        synthetic renal vascular trees physiologically while generating corresponding
        scans of the simulated trees by training a generative model on unlabeled scans.
        This enables the generative model to learn the mapping implicitly without
        the need for explicit functions to emulate the image acquisition process.
        We further propose an additional segmentation branch over the generative model
        trained on the generated scans. We demonstrate that the model can directly
        segment blood vessels on real scans and validate our method on both 3D micro-CT
        scans of rat kidneys and a proof-of-concept experiment on 2D retinal images.

        beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is crucial for building finite element

        they struggle to accurately identify delicate features such as thin structures

      abstract: The renal vasculature, acting as a resource distribution network,
        plays an important role in both the physiology and pathophysiology of the
        kidney. However, no imaging techniques allow an assessment of the structure
        and function of the renal vasculature due to limited spatial and temporal

        to develop new image-based diagnostic methods based on artificial intelligence,
        it is necessary to have a realistic full-scale model of the renal vasculature.

        estimation of cortex area from a micro-CT scan as a starting point, and by

      abstract: 'To put this dissertation in a proper perspective, I feel it is important
        to give a little insight into my background history and motivation for working
        in the field of physicsbased animation.As a first year undergraduate student
        in physics, with a fascination of classical mechanics, the course of my studies
        was layed down, inspired by computer games such as Scorched Earth (Shareware
        Computer Game by Wendell Hicken, 1991) just to mention one. Here, simple Newtonian
        physics was used to compute trajectories of bombs being fired by small tanks
        placed in a 2D landscape. The idea itself of using a computer combined with
        the laws of physics to predict events in a completely dynamic way were so
        interesting and appealing that today I am still captivated with this fascination.
        It did not take long before my study interests moved from physics towards
        computer science. In particular, computer graphics and computer animation
        became the major topics forming a common theme in my (under-) graduate studies.
        Being the sole person at the time in the computer science department having
        this weird craving for doing computer physics, it took considerable time to
        build up the necessary skills and knowledge for performing simulations more
        impressive than computing the trajectory of a thrown ball. A lot of computer
        science disciplines were needed to be learned: Numerical methods, computational
        geometry, and operational research, as well as trained skills in mathematics
        and physics. In May 2001, a study of rigid body simulation methods ended up
        as my Master Thesis. Written as an introductory textbook in simple rigid body

        networks, this paper tackles two commonly encountered problems in biomedical
        imaging: Topological consistency of the segmentation, and expensive or difficult
        annotation. Our contributions are the following: a) We propose a topological
        score which measures both topological and geometric consistency between the
        predicted and ground truth segmentations, applied to model selection and validation.
        b) We provide a full deep-learning methodology for this difficult noisy task
        on time-series image data. In our method, we first use a semisupervised U-net
        architecture, applicable to generic segmentation tasks, which jointly trains
        an autoencoder and a segmentation network. We then use tracking of loops over
        time to further improve the predicted topology. This semi-supervised approach
        allows us to utilize unannotated data to learn feature representations that
        generalize to test data with high variability, in spite of our annotated training
        data having very limited variation. Our contributions are validated on a challenging
        segmentation task, locating tubular structures in the fetal pancreas from
        noisy live imaging confocal microscopy. We show that our semi-supervised model
        outperforms not only fully supervised and pre-trained models but also an approach
        which takes topological consistency into account during training. Further,
        our approach achieves a mean loop score of 0.808 for detecting loops in the
        fetal pancreas, compared to a U-net trained with clDice with mean loop score

      abstract: Segmentation uncertainty models predict a distribution over plausible
        segmentations for a given input, which they learn from the annotator variation
        in the training set. However, in practice these annotations can differ systematically
        in the way they are generated, for example through the use of different labeling
        tools. This results in datasets that contain both data variability and differing
        label styles. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying state-of-the-art
        segmentation uncertainty models on such datasets can lead to model bias caused
        by the different label styles. We present an updated modelling objective conditioning
        on labeling style for aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and modify two state-of-the-art-architectures
        for segmentation uncertainty accordingly. We show with extensive experiments
        that this method reduces label style bias, while improving segmentation performance,
        increasing the applicability of segmentation uncertainty models in the wild.
        We curate two datasets, with annotations in different label styles, which
        we will make publicly available along with our code upon publication.

        impact, but also how much and how long. Results show that, while informational
        support is exchanged most frequently, only emotional support has substantial
        and sustainable impact on peer groups’ sentiment.

      abstract: Out of distribution (OOD) medical images are frequently encountered,
        e.g. because of site- or scanner differences, or image corruption. OOD images
        come with a risk of incorrect image segmentation, potentially negatively affecting
        downstream diagnoses or treatment. To ensure robustness to such incorrect
        segmentations, we propose Laplacian Segmentation Networks (LSN) that jointly
        model epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty in image segmentation.
        We capture data uncertainty with a spatially correlated logit distribution.
        For model uncertainty, we propose the first Laplace approximation of the weight
        posterior that scales to large neural networks with skip connections that
        have high-dimensional outputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that modelling
        spatial pixel correlation allows the Laplacian Segmentation Network to successfully
        assign high epistemic uncertainty to out-of-distribution objects appearing
        within images.

        under refraction, which are essential problems for refractive structure from

        for establishing iterative algorithms to optimize absolute and relative pose.
        By classifying two scenarios according to the geometric relationship between
        the camera and refractive interface, we derive the corresponding solutions
        to solve the optimization problems efficiently. In the scenario where the
        geometry between the camera and refractive interface is fixed (e.g., underwater
        imaging), we also show that the refractive epipolar constraint for relative
        pose can be established as a summation of the classical essential matrix and
        two correction terms caused by refraction by using the virtual camera transformation.
        Thanks to its succinct form, the resulting refractive epipolar constraint
        can be efficiently …

        either the observed data or hidden state variables are confined to a known
        Riemannian manifold. In sequential data analysis this interest has also been
        growing, but rather crude algorithms have been applied: either Monte Carlo

        clearly show a missing gap: no generic analogues to Kalman filters are currently
        available in non-Euclidean domains. In this paper, we remedy this issue by
        first generalising the unscented transform and then the unscented Kalman filter
        to Riemannian manifolds. As the Kalman filter can be viewed as an optimisation
        algorithm akin to the Gauss-Newton method, our algorithm also provides a general-purpose

      abstract: In machine learning, active learning refers to algorithms that autonomously
        select the data points from which they will learn. There are many data mining
        applications in which large amounts of unlabeled data are readily available,
        but labels (e.g., human annotations or results coming  from complex experiments)
        are costly to obtain. In such scenarios, an active learning algorithm aims
        at identifying data points that, if labeled and used for training, would most
        improve the learned model. Labels are then obtained only for the most promising
        data points. This speeds up learning and reduces labeling costs. Support vector
        machine (SVM) classifiers are particularly well‐suited for active learning
        due to their convenient mathematical properties. They perform linear classification,
        typically in a kernel‐induced feature space, which makes expressing  the distance
        of a data point from the decision boundary straightforward …

        We first present an absolute pose estimation algorithm by leveraging an efficient
        iterative refinement. Then, we derive a novel refractive epipolar constraint
        for relative pose estimation. The epipolar constraint is established based
        on the virtual camera transformation, making it in a succinct form and can
        be efficiently optimized. Evaluations of the proposed algorithms on synthetic
        data show superior accuracy and computational efficiency to state-of-the-art
        methods. For further validation, we demonstrate the performance on real data
        and show the application in 3D reconstruction of objects under refraction.

        images utilizing the entire spatio-spectral data cube in convolutional neural
        networks using protein regression analysis of bulk wheat grain kernels as
        a test case. By introducing novel modifications of the well-known convolutional
        neural network, ResNet-18, we are able to significantly increase its performance
        on hyperspectral images. Our modifications consist of firstly applying a 3D
        convolution layer enabling learning of spectral derivatives that 2D spatial
        convolution is unable to learn, and secondly, the application of a (1 x 1)
        2D convolution layer that downsamples the spectral dimension. Analysis of
        the responses learned by the convolution kernels in our modifications reveals
        meaningful representations of the input data cube that reduce noise and enable
        the subsequent ResNet-18 to perform more accurate regression analysis.

      abstract: Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in modeling the
        non-Gaussian structures of natural images. However, despite the many advances
        in the direction of sparse coding and multi-resolution analysis, the full
        probability distribution of pixel values in a neighborhood has not yet been
        described. In this study, we explore the space of data points representing
        the values of 3 × 3 high-contrast patches from optical and 3D range images.
        We find that the distribution of data is extremely “sparse” with the majority
        of the data points concentrated in clusters and non-linear low-dimensional
        manifolds. Furthermore, a detailed study of probability densities allows us
        to systematically distinguish between images of different modalities (optical
        versus range), which otherwise display similar marginal distributions. Our
        work indicates the importance of studying the full probability distribution
        of natural images, not just …

        method for seed quality assessment through combining spectroscopy and imaging.
        Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown to be promising tools
        for red-green-blue (RGB) image or spectral cereal classification. This paper
        describes the design and implementation of deep CNN models capable of utilizing
        both the spatial and spectral dimension of HSI data simultaneously for analysis
        of bulk grain samples with densely packed kernels. Classification of eight
        grain samples, including six different wheat varieties, were used as a test

        on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and have previously been shown to
        occur in COVID-19 cohorts of critically ill patients. We aimed to determine
        the risk of having microbleeds on medically indicated brain MRI and compare
        non-hospitalized COVID-19 infected patients with non-infected controls.Methods:
        in this retrospective case-control study, we included patients over 18 years
        of age, having an MRI with a susceptibility-weighted sequence, between January
        1, 2019, and July 1, 2021. Cases were identified based on a positive reverse
        transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2, and matched with
        three non-exposed controls, based on age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities.
        The number of CMBs on each scan was determined using artificial intelligence.Findings:
        We included 73 cases and 219 matched non-exposed controls. COVID-19 was associated
        with significantly greater odds of having CMBs on MRI; OR 2· 66 (1· 23–5·
        76, 95% confidence interval), increasingly so when patients with dementia
        and hospitalized patients were excluded.Interpretation: Our findings indicate
        that CMBs may be associated with COVID-19 infections. This finding may add
        to the pathophysiological considerations of CMBs and help explain cases of
        incidental CMBs in subjects with previous COVID-19.'

        rethink strategic spa al planning in Denmark. It was increasingly recognised
        within the ministry how societal changes, in par cular globalisa on, had led
        to new challenges for spa al planning, as illustrated in the opening statement
        in the 2006 na onal planning report quoted above. Furthermore, the liberal
        and conserva ve coali on government elected in 2001 had proposed widescale
        changes in the Danish governance structures, including the planning administra
        on. These changes were to be implemented by January 2007 in the Danish structural
        reform. Whilst the structural reform set out to abolish the regional planning
        level in Denmark, the 2006 na onal planning report drew aen on to urban regions
        as the new important scale for strategic spa al planning in Denmark (Ministry

      abstract: Planning theory is often portrayed as a subject that urban planning
        students find too abstract and fail to see the relevance of. This paper advocates
        the perspective that planning theory can be made more student-friendly. This
        requires, firstly, that academic discussions about the relevance of planning
        theory for urban planning practice are integrated into the course module.

      abstract: In the last decade light rail transit systems have become a popular
        mode of public transport in many cities around the world to upgrade the existing
        public transportation network, but also, and perhaps more importantly, to
        support neoliberal urban development strategies. The paper takes its starting
        point in the growing critical literature discussing the politics of light
        rail and related transport infrastructure projects in the context of neoliberalism.
        The paper uses the case of Aalborg, Denmark, to demonstrate how light rail
        projects are embedded in particular infrastructure imaginaries, which reflect
        wider political agendas of promoting urban development and economic growth.
        In the case of Aalborg, the city’s spatial strategies have played an important
        role in constructing an imaginary of the city as the region’s ‘growth dynamo’,
        which in turn have led to a growth-fixated conceptualisation of the city’s

      abstract: The Finger Plan has guided the spatial development of the Greater
        Copenhagen Area for more than 70 years, constituting a planning doctrine in
        Danish spatial planning. However, recently the Finger Plan has come under
        attack from the liberal Danish Government (2015–2019), who implemented a number
        of initiatives to deregulate spatial planning in Denmark, most significantly
        through a ‘modernised’ Planning Act. As part of this process, the Finger Plan
        was revised twice in 2017 and 2019. The latest version of the Finger plan
        was prepared as part of a larger policy package aiming at promoting growth
        in the Greater Copenhagen Region towards 2030. This paper argues that the
        recent revisions of the Finger Plan must be understood as part of the ongoing
        neoliberalization of spatial planning in Denmark, but that the Finger Plan,
        at the same time, has remained ‘immune’ to a more widespread neoliberalization

        planning conducted as persuasive storytelling. It suggests that spatial imaginaries

        lend themselves to the stakeholders’ varying interpretations, and artefactually

        This is demonstrated with the example of Aalborg, Denmark, where the spatial
        imaginary of the ‘growth axis’ and the associated boundary object of the light

      abstract: In this article, we analyse how contested transitions in planning
        rationalities and spatial logics have shaped the processes and outputs of
        recent episodes of Danish “strategic spatial planning”. The practice of “strategic
        spatial planning” in Denmark has undergone a concerted reorientation in the
        recent years as a consequence of an emerging neoliberal agenda promoting a
        growth-oriented planning approach emphasizing a new spatial logic of growth
        centres in the major cities and urban regions. The analysis, of the three
        planning episodes, at different subnational scales, highlights how this new

        continuously challenged by a persistent regulatory, top-down rationality of
        “strategic spatial planning”, rooted in spatial Keynesianism, which has long

      abstract: This paper explores the driving forces behind the promotion of new
        soft spaces of territorial governance in Denmark at the scale of city regions,
        the so-called business regions. We interpret the emergence of business regions
        as outcomes of the most recent round of reterritorialisation in Denmark, producing
        new spaces for promoting neoliberal policy agendas of competitiveness, job
        creation and economic growth. We argue that the business regions should not
        only be understood as products of neoliberalisation, but also as spaces of
        neoliberal experimentation, contributing to the normalisation of policy agendas
        of job creation and business development as taken-for-granted planning objectives.
        We conclude that the new business regions emerging at the scale of city regions
        constitute new political spaces for reworking the Danish planning culture
        in the context of neoliberalism. We suggest that this development can …

      abstract: Strategic spatial planning has played an important role in shaping
        the political geographies of the state since the mid-twentieth century in
        many European countries. 1 In the Nordic countries, spatial planning became
        an integral part of developing the modern welfare state. Here, spatial strategies,
        visions and plans were prepared in order to ‘tame’urbanization and economic
        growth, and canalize development into prioritized (often ‘underdeveloped’)
        areas (Carter et al. 2015; Moisio and Leppänen 2007). As part of this project,
        planning and spatial politics were upscaled to the entire state territory,
        and ‘planning became a territory-wide spatialisation of the welfare state
        objective of material growth and social equalization’(Carter et al. 2015,
        p. 9). This project was often guided by the spatial imaginary of the welfare
        state as a geographical whole and spatial policies of strengthening the spatial
        cohesion and unity of the state. In this era of spatial Keynesianism, state
        investments in transport infrastructure, healthcare, education, culture, etc.
        were spread across the state’s geography. Under this paradigm, strategic spatial
        planning developed largely as a technocratic discipline, a statecraft (Scott
        1998) designed to construct the ‘optimal’geography of the welfare state, inspired
        by studies such as

        spatial strategies: the case of Denmark'
    K9aQCYQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC:
      abstract: With this paper I analyse how policy agendas are being shaped and
        reshaped in new soft spaces emerging in Danish spatial planning at subnational
        scales, and how policy making in these soft spaces seeks to influence formal
        planning arenas. The paper demonstrates how the new soft planning spaces in
        Danish spatial planning primarily are concerned with promoting policy agendas
        centred on economic development, whilst doing limited work in filling in the
        gaps between formal scales of planning, as envisaged in the planning literature.
        Instead, soft spaces seem to add to the increasing pressures on statutory
        spatial planning, being used as vehicles for neoliberal transformations of
        strategic spatial planning. I therefore argue for a need to maintain a critical
        stance towards the emergence of soft spaces in spatial planning.

    K9aQCYQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C:
      abstract: Strategic spatial planning practices have recently taken a neoliberal
        turn in many northwestern European countries. This neoliberalisation of strategic
        spatial planning has materialised partly in governance reforms aiming to reduce
        or abolish strategic spatial planning at national and regional scales, and
        partly through the normalisation of neoliberal discourses in strategic spatial
        planning processes. This article analyses the complex relationship, partly
        of unease and partly of coevolution, between neoliberalism and strategic spatial
        planning. Furthermore, this article discusses the key challenges for strategic
        spatial planning in the face of neoliberalism and argues for a need to strengthen
        strategic spatial planning’s critical dimension.

      abstract: 'Public authorities make decisions that greatly impact both citizens
        and non-citizens. Decision-making on asylum, which is regulated by international
        law but administered by states, in particular is characterised by a higher
        level of secrecy than other public services. The 1951 Refugee Convention defnes
        refugeehood as the fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
        nationality, social group, or political opinion. Although fear of gender-related
        persecution was not included as one of the grounds meriting asylum, state
        practice means that it is today generally recognised as such. The United Nations
        Refugee Agency (UNHCR) recommends that states" ensure a gender-sensitive interpretation
        of the 1951 Refugee Convention." Using natural language processing (NLP) to
        analyse an open dataset of Danish asylum case summaries, we frst identify
        fve empirical categories connected to gender in the case summaries: 1) gender-related
        persecution, 2) LGBT 3) sexual conditions, 4) marital conditions and 5) other
        gender-related forms of persecution. Secondly, we illustrate the relationship
        between these gender-related categories and other categories/topics in asylum
        motives. Finally, we discuss how data science techniques can be applied to
        better understand complex, cooperative work practices in an area where access
        for researchers is limited, but archival data is available.'

        practices. The full-day workshop, designed for up to 20 participants, advances
        a CSCW-perspective on algorithmic/AI systems by bringing together researchers
        within (and where possible beyond) the CSCW community who study algorithmic
        systems, with the aim of sharing ongoing research and connecting participants
        with others who share their research interests.

        of sequence variation. While human genome sequence diversity is increasingly
        well characterized, there is a need for efficient ways to use this knowledge
        in sequence analysis. Here we present Graphtyper, a publicly available novel

        both biological and behavioural. The effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions
        can be attributed largely to changes in human behaviour, but quantifying this

        distinct groups of persons. Methods The transmission tree enables us to model
        the effect that a given population prevalence of vaccination would have had
        on the third wave had one of three different vaccination strategies been implemented
        before that time. This allows us to compare the effectiveness of the strategies

        parents affect de novo mutations, here we sequence 1,548 Icelanders, their
        parents, and, for a subset of 225, at least one child, to 35× genome-wide

        a quarter of the 1.51 per year from fathers (95% CI 1.45–1.57). The number
        of clustered mutations increases faster with the mother’s age than with the

      abstract: The last decades have seen great leaps made in the development of
        RNA sequencing technologies, yielding lower cost and greater throughput of
        experiments, to the point where the scale of the data produced on a daily
        basis is staggering. While computational hardware is also continuously improving,
        famously (or perhaps infamously) described by Gordon Moore (Moore, 1965),
        the rate at which data are produced eclipses advances on the hardware front.
        Over the last few years, many new methods have been proposed for bridging
        that ever-widening chasm, more than a few of which harness the latent graphical
        structure of genomic data to reduce the number of calculations required and
        pack the data tighter in memory. This body of work continues this development
        on three different, but related, fronts. Firstly, I present developments that
        greatly improve upon the efficiency of state-of-the-art methods for the quantification
        of RNA-seq reads, and describe a method that improves the accuracy of quantification
        without substantially increasing the computational over- head. Secondly, I
        introduce a procedure for the discovery of associations between novel gene
        isoforms and phenotypes, without prior knowledge of those isoforms. Lastly,
        I present the largest reconstruction of the transmission tree of a viral outbreak
        to date, modeled from viral genome sequences, contact tracing, and symptom
        data. I then use the reconstructed transmission tree to assess the efficacy
        of different vaccination strategies.

      abstract: De novo mutations (DNMs) cause a large proportion of severe rare diseases
        of childhood. DNMs that occur early may result in mosaicism of both somatic
        and germ cells. Such early mutations can cause recurrence of disease. We scanned
        1,007 sibling pairs from 251 families and identified 878 DNMs shared by siblings
        (ssDNMs) at 448 genomic sites. We estimated DNM recurrence probability based
        on parental mosaicism, sharing of DNMs among siblings, parent-of-origin, mutation
        type and genomic position. We detected 57.2% of ssDNMs in the parental blood.
        The recurrence probability of a DNM decreases by 2.27% per year for paternal
        DNMs and 1.78% per year for maternal DNMs. Maternal ssDNMs are more likely
        to be T>C mutations than paternal ssDNMs, and less likely to be C>T mutations.
        Depending on the properties of the DNM, the recurrence probability ranges

        variants passing GATK filters: 31,079,378 SNPs and 7,940,790 indels. Calling
        de novo mutations (DNMs) is a formidable challenge given the high false positive
        rate in sequencing datasets relative to the mutation rate. Here we addressed
        this issue by using segregation of alleles in three-generation families. Using
        this transmission assay, we controlled the false positive rate and identified
        108,778 high quality DNMs. Furthermore, we used our extended family structure
        and read pair tracing of DNMs to a panel of phased SNPs, to determine the
        parent of origin of 42,961 DNMs.'

      abstract: The connection between migraine aura and headache is poorly understood.
        Some patients experience migraine aura without headache, and patients with
        migraine aura with headache commonly experience milder headaches with age.
        The distance between the cerebral cortex and the overlying dura mater has
        been hypothesized to influence development of headache following aura. We
        tested this hypothesis by comparing approximated distances between visual
        cortical areas and overlying dura mater between female patients with migraine
        aura without headache and female patients with migraine aura with headache.Twelve
        cases with migraine aura without headache and 45 age-matched controls with
        migraine aura with headache underwent 3.0 T MRI. We calculated average distances
        between the occipital lobes, between the calcarine sulci, and between the
        skull and visual areas V1, V2 …

      abstract: Sleep studies are important for diagnosing sleep disorders such as
        insomnia, narcolepsy or sleep apnea. They rely on manual scoring of sleep
        stages from raw polisomnography signals, which is a tedious visual task requiring
        the workload of highly trained professionals. Consequently, research efforts
        to purse for an automatic stage scoring based on machine learning techniques
        have been carried out over the last years. In this work, we resort to multitaper
        spectral analysis to create visually interpretable images of sleep patterns
        from EEG signals as inputs to a deep convolutional network trained to solve
        visual recognition tasks. As a working example of transfer learning, a system
        able to accurately classify sleep stages in new unseen patients is presented.

      abstract: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) aims at modulating brain activity
        by inducing electric fields in the brain [1]. The electric fields are generated
        either by a magnetic coil, in the case of transcranial magnetic stimulation
        (TMS), or by a current source and electrodes placed directly on the scalp,
        in the case of transcranial electric stimulation (TES). In both cases, the
        induced electric fields in the brain have a complex and often counter-intuitive
        spatial distribution, which is dependent on the individual anatomy of a target
        subject. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in moving away
        from a one-size-fits-all stimulation approach in NIBS to more individually
        informed protocols [2]. The driving force behind this shift is the

        important for accurate forward modeling of the electric field during transcranial

        In particular, the skull compartment exerts a strong influence on the field
        distribution due to its low conductivity, suggesting the need to represent
        its geometry accurately. However, automatic skull reconstruction from structural
        magnetic resonance (MR) images is difficult, as compact bone has a very low

        (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are many. Familiar sources
        include low-frequency drift due to hardware imperfections, oscillatory noise

        genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community.
        The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating
        the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori
        hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate
        approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest
        reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in
        the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related
        areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed
        maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's

      abstract: Most experimental protocols examining joint attention with the gaze
        cueing paradigm are “observational” and “offline”, thereby not involving social
        interaction. We examined whether within a naturalistic online interaction,
        real-time eye contact influences the gaze cueing effect (GCE). We embedded
        gaze cueing in an interactive protocol with the iCub humanoid robot. This
        has the advantage of ecological validity combined with excellent experimental
        control. Critically, before averting the gaze, iCub either established eye
        contact or not, a manipulation enabled by an algorithm detecting position
        of the human eyes. For non-predictive gaze cueing procedure (Experiment 1),
        only the eye contact condition elicited GCE, while for counter-predictive
        procedure (Experiment 2), only the condition with no eye contact induced GCE.
        These results reveal an interactive effect of strategic (gaze validity) and

        was evaluated by users, dependent on established eye contact. In two experiments,
        the robot was programmed to either establish eye contact with the user, or
        to look elsewhere. Across the experiments, we altered the level of predictiveness
        of the robot’s gaze direction with respect to a subsequent target stimulus
        (in Exp.1 the gaze direction was non-predictive, in Exp. 2 it was counter-predictive).
        Results of subjective reports showed that participants were sensitive to eye
        contact. Moreover, participants felt more engaged with the robot when it established
        eye contact, and the majority attributed higher degree of human-likeness in
        the eye contact condition, relative to no eye contact. This was independent
        of predictiveness of the gaze cue. Our results suggest that establishing eye

      abstract: In the last decade scientist started bridging the traditional laboratory
        based experimental protocols to investigate human social cognition, with more
        ecological and “into the wild” protocols where we spontaneously employ our
        socio-cognitive mechanisms differently compared to more controlled environments,
        in line with the second person neuroscience approach. As this framework implies
        transferring 2-D paradigms to 3-D interactive environments, the risk of losing
        experimental control, and thus, precision in experimental replicability arises.
        Therefore, we propose a set of methods to investigate human social cognition
        in 3-D environments, with an embodied humanoid robot as an integrative tool
        to overcome replicability issues. To this end, we present two case studies
        where our methods and tools were applied and replicated across two different
        laboratories, namely the Italian Institute of Technology in Genova (Italy)
        and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore. In the first
        case study, we present a replication of an adapted of a gaze cueing paradigm
        presented by Kompatsiari et al.(2022) developed to investigate the role of
        eye contact in joint attention. The second case study presents a replication
        of a paradigm presented by Marchesi et al.,(2022), developed to investigate
        the attribution of mental states to humanoid robots. We argue that our set
        of methods and tools shows that complex experimental paradigms can also be
        transferable across Countries, to allow, for example cross-cultural comparisons,
        without sacrificing experimental control and resources.

        After reviewing classical approaches that address joint attention mechanisms

        interact with one another. The fundamental nature of joint attention in the
        context of social cognition has led researchers to develop tasks that address
        this mechanism and operationalize it in a laboratory setting, in the form
        of a gaze cueing paradigm. In the present study, we addressed the question
        of whether engaging in joint attention with a robot face is culture-specific.
        We adapted a classical gaze-cueing paradigm such that a robot avatar cued
        participants’ gaze subsequent to either engaging participants in eye contact
        or not. Our critical question of interest was whether the gaze cueing effect
        (GCE) is stable across different cultures, especially if cognitive resources
        to exert top-down control are reduced. To achieve the latter, we introduced

      abstract: Sense of Agency (SoA) is the feeling of control over one’s actions
        and their outcomes. A well-established implicit measure of SoA is the temporal
        interval estimation paradigm, in which participants estimate the time interval
        between a voluntary action and its sensory consequence. In the present study,
        we aimed to investigate whether the valence of action outcome modulated implicit
        SoA. The valence was manipulated through interaction partner’s (i) positive/negative
        facial expression, or (ii) type of gaze (gaze contact or averted gaze). The
        interaction partner was the humanoid robot iCub. In Experiment 1, participants
        estimated the time interval between the onset of their action (head movement
        towards the robot), and the robot’s facial expression (happy vs. sad face).
        Experiment 2 was identical, but the outcome of participants’ action was the
        type of robot’s gaze (gaze contact vs. averted). In Experiment 3, we assessed

      abstract: ' Mutual gaze is a key element of human development, and constitutes
        an important factor in human interactions. In this study, we examined –through
        analysis of subjective reports– the influence of an online eye-contact of
        a humanoid robot on humans’ reception of the robot. To this end, we manipulated
        the robot gaze, i.e., mutual (social) gaze and neutral (non-social) gaze,
        throughout an experiment involving letter identification. Our results suggest
        that people are sensitive to the mutual gaze of an artificial agent, they
        feel more engaged with the robot when a mutual gaze is established, and eye-contact
        supports attributing human-like characteristics to the robot. These findings
        are relevant both to the human-robot interaction (HRI) research - enhancing
        social behavior of robots, and also for cognitive neuroscience - studying
        mechanisms of social cognition in relatively realistic social interactive
        scenarios.'

      abstract: We present an economic model of systemic risk in which undercapitalization
        of the financial sector as a whole is assumed to harm the real economy, leading
        to a systemic risk externality. Each financial institution’s contribution
        to systemic risk can be measured as its systemic expected shortfall (SES),
        that is, its propensity to be undercapitalized when the system as a whole
        is undercapitalized. SES increases in the institution’s leverage and its marginal
        expected shortfall (MES), that is, its losses in the tail of the system’s
        loss distribution. We demonstrate empirically the ability of components of
        SES to predict emerging systemic risk during the financial crisis of 2007–2009.Received

      abstract: We propose a new asset pricing framework in which all securities'
        signals predict each individual return. While the literature focuses on securities'
        own‐signal predictability, assuming equal strength across securities, our
        framework includes cross‐predictability—leading to three main results. First,
        we derive the optimal strategy in closed form. It consists of eigenvectors
        of a “prediction matrix,” which we call “principal portfolios.” Second, we
        decompose the problem into alpha and beta, yielding optimal strategies with,
        respectively, zero and positive factor exposure. Third, we provide a new test
        of asset pricing models. Empirically, principal portfolios deliver significant
        out‐of‐sample alphas to standard factors in several data sets.

      abstract: We find consistent value and momentum return premia across eight diverse
        markets and asset classes, and a strong common factor structure among their
        returns. Value and momentum returns correlate more strongly across asset classes
        than passive exposures to the asset classes, but value and momentum are negatively
        correlated with each other, both within and across asset classes. Our results
        indicate the presence of common global risks that we characterize with a three‐factor
        model. Global funding liquidity risk is a partial source of these patterns,
        which are identifiable only when examining value and momentum jointly across
        markets. Our findings present a challenge to existing behavioral, institutional,
        and rational asset pricing theories that largely focus on U.S. equities.

      abstract: This paper examines whether capital structure is irrelevant for enterprise
        value and investment when investors care about environmental, social, and
        governance issues, which we denote “ESG-Modigliani-Miller”(ESG-MM). Theoretically,
        we show that ESG-MM holds if ESG is additive and markets are perfect. ESG-MM
        means that issuing low-yielding green bonds does not lower the overall cost
        of capital because it makes the issuer's other securities browner. Hence,
        a firm's incentive to make a green investment does not depend on its financing
        choice. Empirically, we provide evidence of failure of ESG-MM, implying that
        firms and governments can exploit non-additive ESG or segmented markets.

        US equities, 20 international equity markets, Treasury bonds, corporate bonds,
        and futures. (2) A betting against beta (BAB) factor, which is long leveraged
        low-beta assets and short high-beta assets, produces significant positive
        risk-adjusted returns. (3) When funding constraints tighten, the return of

      abstract: We provide a model that links an asset's market liquidity (i.e., the
        ease with which it is traded) and traders' funding liquidity (i.e., the ease
        with which they can obtain funding). Traders provide market liquidity, and
        their ability to do so depends on their availability of funding. Conversely,
        traders' funding, i.e., their capital and margin requirements, depends on
        the assets' market liquidity. We show that, under certain conditions, margins
        are destabilizing and market liquidity and funding liquidity are mutually
        reinforcing, leading to liquidity spirals. The model explains the empirically
        documented features that market liquidity (i) can suddenly dry up, (ii) has
        commonality across securities, (iii) is related to volatility, (iv) is subject
        to “flight to quality,” and (v) co-moves with the market. The model provides
        new testable predictions, including that speculators' capital is a driver
        of market liquidity and risk premiums.

      abstract: This paper solves explicitly a simple equilibrium model with liquidity
        risk. In our liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's
        required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances
        of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition,
        a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous
        returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework
        for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect
        asset prices. Our empirical results shed light on the total and relative economic
        significance of these channels and provide evidence of flight to liquidity.

      abstract: Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the dramatic and unsteady
        evolution of the cryptocurrency market has also been driven by large investments
        by traditional and cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds. Notwithstanding their
        critical role, our understanding of the relationship between institutional
        investments and the evolution of the cryptocurrency market has remained limited,
        also due to the lack of comprehensive data describing investments over time.
        In this study, we present a quantitative study of cryptocurrency institutional
        investments based on a dataset collected for 1324 currencies in the period
        between 2014 and 2022 from Crunchbase, one of the largest platforms gathering
        business information. We show that the evolution of the cryptocurrency market
        capitalization is highly correlated with the size of institutional investments,
        thus confirming their important role. Further, we find that the market is
        dominated by the presence of a group of prominent investors who tend to specialise
        by focusing on particular technologies. Finally, studying the co-investment
        network of currencies that share common investors, we show that assets with
        shared investors tend to be characterized by similar market behavior. Our
        work sheds light on the role played by institutional investors and provides
        a basis for further research on their influence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        are used to construct an efficient, parameter-free indicator of the material
        strength that is solely based on the particle size and spatial distribution,
        thus proving that network science can advance the understanding of strength

        of individual and collective mobility patterns. On the one hand, a highly
        influential body of literature on human mobility driven by analyses of massive
        empirical datasets finds that human movements show no evidence of characteristic
        spatial scales. There, human mobility is described as scale free–. On the
        other hand, geographically, the concept of scale—referring to meaningful levels
        of description from individual buildings to neighbourhoods, cities, regions
        and countries—is central for the description of various aspects of human behaviour,
        such as socioeconomic interactions, or political and cultural dynamics,. Here
        we resolve this apparent paradox by showing that day-to-day human mobility
        does indeed contain meaningful scales, corresponding to spatial ‘containers’
        that restrict mobility behaviour. The scale-free results arise from aggregating

        tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility patterns is considered.
        We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly yet smoothly, and that
        the number of familiar locations an individual visits at any point is a conserved
        quantity with a typical size of ~25. We use this finding to improve state-of-the-art

        robots, are required. However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously
        difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are
        introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories
        of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies
        that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises.
        In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills
        for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived
        from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred
        to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented
        on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the …

      abstract: 'Computer vision can lead toward more sustainable agricultural production
        by enabling robotic precision agriculture. Vision‐equipped robots are being
        deployed in the fields to take care of crops and control weeds. However, publicly
        available agricultural datasets containing both image data as well as data

        for robotic applications. It allows for more robust object detection, incorporating
        temporal aspects and considering different viewpoints of the same object.

      abstract: Autonomous weeding robots need to accurately detect the joint stem
        of grassland weeds in order to control those weeds in an effective and energy-efficient
        manner. In this work, keypoints on joint stems and bounding boxes around weeds
        in grasslands are detected jointly using multi-task learning. We compare a
        two-stage, heatmap-based architecture to a single-stage, regression-based
        architecture—both based on the popular YOLOv5 object detector. Our results
        show that introducing joint-stem detection as a second task boosts the individual
        weed detection performance in both architectures. Furthermore, the single-stage
        architecture clearly outperforms its competitors with an OKS of 56.3 in joint-stem
        detection while also achieving real-time performance of 12.2 FPS on Nvidia
        Jetson NX, suitable for agricultural robots. Finally, we make the newly created
        joint-stem ground-truth annotations publicly available for the relevant research
        community.

      abstract: Many robotic and machine-vision applications rely on the accurate
        results of stereo correspondence algorithms. However, difficult environmental
        conditions, such as differentiations in illumination depending on the viewpoint,
        heavily affect the stereo algorithms’ performance. This work proposes a new
        illumination-invariant dissimilarity measure in order to substitute the established
        intensity-based ones. The proposed measure can be adopted by almost any of
        the existing stereo algorithms, enhancing it with its robust features. The
        performance of the dissimilarity measure is validated through experimentation
        with a new adaptive support weight (ASW) stereo correspondence algorithm.
        Experimental results for a variety of lighting conditions are gathered and
        compared to those of intensity-based algorithms. The algorithm using the proposed
        dissimilarity measure outperforms all the other examined algorithms, exhibiting

        This paper investigates how the density of structural features can be used
        to assist the training process of a Deep-Learning-based object detector. SIFT
        keypoint density is used to create overlay masks to augment images, emphasizing
        low-density areas—typically corresponding to weed plants. Our method is shown

      abstract: Reinforcement learning is an appealing approach for allowing robots
        to learn new tasks. Relevant literature reveals a plethora of methods, but
        at the same time makes clear the lack of implementations for dealing with
        real life challenges. Current expectations raise the demand for adaptable
        robots. We argue that, by employing model-based reinforcement learning, the—now
        limited—adaptability characteristics of robotic systems can be expanded. Also,
        model-based reinforcement learning exhibits advantages that makes it more
        applicable to real life use-cases compared to model-free methods. Thus, in
        this survey, model-based methods that have been applied in robotics are covered.
        We categorize them based on the derivation of an optimal policy, the definition
        of the returns function, the type of the transition model and the learned
        task. Finally, we discuss the applicability of model-based reinforcement …

      abstract: Recent advances in both anthropomorphic robots and bimanual industrial
        manipulators had led to an increased interest in the specific problems pertaining
        to dual arm manipulation. For the future, we foresee robots performing human-like
        tasks in both domestic and industrial settings. It is therefore natural to
        study specifics of dual arm manipulation in humans and methods for using the
        resulting knowledge in robot control. The related scientific problems range
        from low-level control to high level task planning and execution. This review

        of fields that study the different aspects of these problems specifically
        in dual arm manipulation.

      abstract: Applying natural language processing for mining and intelligent information
        access to tweets (a form of microblog) is a challenging, emerging research
        area. Unlike carefully authored news text and other longer content, tweets
        pose a number of new challenges, due to their short, noisy, context-dependent,

        in a pipeline, comprising consecutive stages of language identification, tokenisation,

        recognition and disambiguation, investigating how robust a number of state-of-the-art

      abstract: Many recent improvements in NLP stem from the development and use
        of large pre-trained language models (PLMs) with billions of parameters. Large
        model sizes makes computational cost one of the main limiting factors for
        training and evaluating such models; and has raised severe concerns about
        the sustainability, reproducibility, and inclusiveness for researching PLMs.
        These concerns are often based on personal experiences and observations. However,
        there had not been any large-scale surveys that investigate them. In this
        work, we provide a first attempt to quantify these concerns regarding three
        topics, namely, environmental impact, equity, and impact on peer reviewing.
        By conducting a survey with 312 participants from the NLP community, we capture
        existing (dis)parities between different and within groups with respect to
        seniority, academia, and industry; and their impact on the peer reviewing
        process. For each topic, we provide an analysis and devise recommendations
        to mitigate found disparities, some of which already successfully implemented.
        Finally, we discuss additional concerns raised by many participants in free-text
        responses.

      abstract: Prediction of a $\textbf{varying number}$ of $\textbf{ordered clusters}$
        from sets of $\textbf{any cardinality}$ is a challenging task for neural networks,
        combining elements of set representation, clustering and learning to order.
        This task arises in many diverse areas, ranging from medical triage and early
        discharge, through machine part management and multi-channel signal analysis
        for petroleum exploration to product catalog structure prediction. This paper
        focuses on that last area, which exemplifies a number of challenges inherent
        to adaptive ordered clustering, referred to further as the eponymous $\textit{Catalog
        Problem}$. These include learning variable cluster constraints, exhibiting
        relational reasoning and managing combinatorial complexity. Despite progress
        in both neural clustering and set-to-sequence methods, no joint, fully differentiable
        model exists to-date. We develop such a modular architecture, referred to
        further as Neural Ordered Clusters (NOC), enhance it with a specific mechanism
        for learning cluster-level cardinality constraints, and provide a robust comparison
        of its performance in relation to alternative models. We test our method on
        three datasets, including synthetic catalog structures and PROCAT, a dataset
        of real-world catalogs consisting of over 1.5M products, achieving state-of-the-art
        results on a new, more challenging formulation of the underlying problem,
        which has not been addressed before. Additionally, we examine the network's
        ability to learn higher-order interactions.

    Ifwn1J8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC:
      abstract: Regulatory requirements weighing on roboticists are becoming heavier,
        and at the same time, the activity of producing robots is theorized as creating
        new types of legal risks. Roboticists become responsible not only for compliance
        to a set of regulatory objectives, but they also become responsible for giving
        machines an ability to make decisions in uncertain environments. All of this
        gives roboticists’ legal literacy a newfound importance, and reveals the lack
        of data on that population from a socio-legal angle. While we have some knowledge
        of lawyers’ and policy makers’ concerns for robots, we do not know how roboticists
        understand their relationship to law and regulation, or the legal value they
        attribute to various engineering processes. This article offers a preliminary
        exploration of that population and of their legal concerns, through interviews
        of ten engineers from Danish robotics companies. The analysis shows …

        robots’, 1 it was not until the publication of Human Rights Watch’s influential

      abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly expected to disrupt the
        ordinary functioning of society. From how we fight wars or govern society,
        to how we work and play, and from how we create to how we teach and learn,
        there is almost no field of human activity which is believed to be entirely
        immune from the impact of this emerging technology. This poses a multifaceted
        problem when it comes to designing and understanding regulatory responses
        to AI. This article aims to:(i) defend the need for a novel conceptual model
        for understanding the systemic legal disruption caused by new technologies
        such as AI;(ii) to situate this model in relation to preceding debates about
        the interaction of regulation with new technologies (particularly the ‘cyberlaw’and
        ‘robolaw’debates); and (iii) to set out a detailed model for understanding
        the legal disruption precipitated by AI, examining both pathways stemming
        from new affordances that can give rise to a regulatory ‘disruptive moment’,
        as well as the Legal Development, Displacement or Destruction that can ensue.
        The article proposes that this model of legal disruption can be broadly generalisable
        to understanding the legal effects and challenges of other emerging technologies.

      abstract: In blockchain, every full node has to store all history transactions
        in block bodies. However, with the rapid growth of transactions, the storage
        bloating problem has emerged, and made it challenging for a mobile system
        to afford the storage and synchronization overhead. This paper proposes to
        downsample block bodies to reduce the nodes' storage. By downsampling block
        bodies by M times, only about 1/M of the block bodies with high information
        entropy are downloaded and stored. Performance analysis demonstrates that
        the proposed downsampling nodes and full nodes have similar broadcast accuracy
        with appropriate M. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
        can provide a better cost-effective choice for nodes between broadcast accuracy
        and storage.

      abstract: Blind identification for channel codes are essential in adaptive modulation
        and coding (AMC) systems. Since Turbo codes are popular in AMC systems, it's
        necessary to identify its parameters. In this paper, we focus on the identification
        for Turbo codes from a closed-set. The proposed approach firstly identifies
        the first component code by accumulating Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) for syndrome
        a posteriori probability, then the interleaver and the other component code
        are identified by decoding based on zero insertion and LLR accumulation. This
        approach is robust to noise due to LLR. Moreover, it applies to both symmetric
        Turbo codes with two same component codes and asymmetric Turbo codes with
        two different component codes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
        blind identification scheme is able to identify Turbo codes at signal-to-noise
        ratio (SNR) larger than 3.5dB.

      abstract: In the soft-input soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA), the log-likelihood
        ratio (LLR) of each bit is determined by the minimum metric difference between
        the ML path and its competitive paths. This paper proposes to trim large metric
        differences in order to reduce the complexity of SOVA. By trimming the metric
        differences, only a small number of backtracking operations are carried out,
        while many LLRs may be omitted as the result of the lack of metric differences.
        By revealing the relationship among neighboring LLRs, the omitted LLRs are
        estimated from its neighoring LLRs as well as intrinsic information. The extrinsic
        information transfer chart analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm
        has similar convergence behavior as the Log-MAP algorithm, if the trimming
        factor M is moderate. Other analyses verify that our approach provides good
        LLR quality with only at most 1/M backtracking operations of SOVA …

        between distributed nodes. However, it's a challenge to store the large amount
        of data produced by blockchain. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce node
        storage overhead while ensuring node independence and data recoverability.
        This paper proposes to downsample these data to reduce the storage overhead

        entropy of blockchain and the block bodies are continuously stored. Moreover,

        interpretations of such solutions are of importance, meaning that the surplus

        component analysis and sparse discriminant analysis which are not available

        random forest (RF) models. RF is a popular and useful tool for non-linear
        multi-variate classification and regression, which yields a good trade-off
        between robustness (low variance) and adaptiveness (low bias). Direct interpretation
        of a RF model is difficult, as the explicit ensemble model of hundreds of
        deep trees is complex. Nonetheless, it is possible to visualize a RF model
        fit by its mapping from feature space to prediction space. Hereby the user
        is first presented with the overall geometrical shape of the model structure,
        and when needed one can zoom in on local details. Dimensional reduction by
        projection is used to visualize high dimensional shapes. The traditional method
        to visualize RF model structure, partial dependence plots, achieve this by
        averaging multiple parallel projections. We suggest to first use feature contributions,
        a method to decompose trees by splitting features, and then subsequently perform
        projections. The advantages of forest floor over partial dependence plots
        is that interactions are not masked by averaging. As a consequence, it is
        possible to locate interactions, which are not visualized in a given projection.
        Furthermore, we introduce: a goodness-of-visualization measure, use of colour
        gradients to identify interactions and an out-of-bag cross validated variant
        of feature contributions.'

      abstract: Solving linear programming (LP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) problems
        is momentous because of their wide applications in real-life problems. There
        is no unified way to find the global optimum for NLPs. But on the other hand,
        the simplex algorithm, as the dominating methodology for LPs for several decades
        moves only on the boundary (vertices) and ignores the vast majority of the
        feasible region in the process of searching. In this article, we study two
        gradient-based methodologies that explore the whole feasible region, which
        guarantee faster convergence rates for both LP and NLP optimization problems
        including IoT problems such as Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SDIoV)
        and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The gradient-simplex algorithm (GSA)

      abstract: In 2018 the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed to cut
        the shipping sector’s overall CO2 output by 50% by 2050. One of the key methods
        in reaching this goal is to improve operations to limit fuel consumption.
        However, it is difficult to optimize speed for a complete liner shipping network
        as routes interact with each other, and several business constraints must
        be respected. This paper presents a unified model for speed optimization of
        a liner shipping network, satisfying numerous real-life business constraints.
        The speed optimization is in this research achieved by rescheduling the port
        call times of a network, thus, the network is not changed. The business constraints
        are among others related to transit times, port work shifts and emission control
        areas. Other restrictions are fixed times for canal crossing, speed restrictions
        in the piracy areas and desire for robust solutions. Vessel sharing agreements
        and …

      abstract: The network design problem in liner shipping is of increasing importance
        in a strongly competitive market where potential cost reductions can influence
        market share and profits significantly. In this paper the network design and
        fleet assignment problems are combined into a mixed integer linear programming
        model minimizing the overall cost. To better reflect the real-life situation
        we take into account the cost of transhipment, a heterogeneous fleet, route
        dependent capacities, and butterfly routes. To the best of our knowledge it
        is the first time an exact solution method to the problem considers transhipment
        cost. The problem is solved with branch-and-cut using clover and transhipment
        inequalities. Computational results are reported for instances with up to
        15 ports.

      abstract: Roll-on roll-off (RoRo) shipping plays an important role in freight
        transport on the European continent, and is faced with the challenge of reducing
        its CO 2 emissions while increasing its efficiency. Dual cycling, in which
        loading and discharging processes are carried out simultaneously, achieves
        this goal by reducing the turnaround time of vessels in port and thus the
        CO 2 output of handling equipment in port and fuel consumption through slow
        steaming at sea. Optimizing the dual cycling operations on RoRo vessels has
        not yet been investigated in the literature. This paper presents the novel
        RoRo dual cycling problem (RRDCP), and formulates it using integer programming
        (IP) with the objective to minimize the total makespan of discharging and
        loading operations. We further prove that the RRDCP is NP-complete by a reduction
        from a general machine scheduling problem, and introduce a novel heuristic
        to solve …

      abstract: The largest airports have a daily average throughput of more than
        500 passengers with reduced mobility. The problem of transporting these passengers
        is in some cases a multi-modal transportation problem with synchronization
        constraints. A description of the problem together with a mathematical model
        is presented. The objective is to schedule as many of the passengers as possible,
        while ensuring a smooth transport with short waiting times. A simulated annealing
        based heuristic for solving the problem is presented. The algorithm makes
        use of an abstract representation of a candidate solution which in each step
        is transformed to an actual schedule by use of a greedy heuristic. Local search
        is performed on the abstract representation using advanced neighborhoods which
        modify large parts of the candidate solution. Computational results show that
        the algorithm is able to find good solutions within a couple of …

      abstract: Overcrowding of hospital wards is a well-known and often revisited
        problem in the literature, yet it appears in many different variations. In
        this study, we present a mathematical model to solve the problem of ensuring
        sufficient beds to hospital wards by re-distributing beds that are already
        available to the hospital. Patient flow is modeled using a homogeneous continuous-time
        Markov chain and optimization is conducted using a local search heuristic.
        Our model accounts for patient relocation, which has not been done analytically
        in literature with similar scope. The study objective is to ensure that patient
        occupancy is reflected by our Markov chain model, and that a local optimum
        can be derived within a reasonable runtime.Using a Danish hospital as our
        case study, the Markov chain model is statistically found to reflect occupancy
        of hospital beds by patients as a function of how hospital beds are distributed

      abstract: In this paper speed optimization of an existing liner shipping network
        is solved by adjusting the port berth times. The objective is to minimize
        fuel consumption while retaining the customer transit times including the
        transhipment times. To avoid too many changes to the time table, changes of
        port berth times are only accepted if they lead to savings above a threshold
        value. Since the fuel consumption of a vessel is a non-linear convex function
        of the speed, it is approximated by a piecewise linear function. The developed
        model is solved using exact methods in less than two minutes for large instances.
        Computational experiments on real-size liner shipping networks are presented
        showing that fuels savings in the magnitude 2–10% can be obtained. The work
        has been carried out in collaboration with Maersk Line and the tests instances
        are confirmed to be representative of real-life networks.

      abstract: Shortest path problems appear as subproblems in numerous optimization
        problems. In most papers concerning multiple objective shortest path problems,
        additivity of the objective is a de-facto assumption, but in many real-life
        situations objectives and criteria, can be non-additive. The purpose of this
        paper is to give a general framework for dominance tests for problems involving
        a number of non-additive criteria. These dominance tests can help to eliminate
        paths in a dynamic programming framework when using multiple objectives. Results
        on real-life multi-objective problems containing non-additive criteria are
        reported. We show that in many cases the framework can be used to efficiently
        reduce the number of generated paths.

      abstract: Patients with diabetes and health personnel do not have an optimal
        way of interacting. Health personnel must use multiple ICT systems, such as
        third-party companies’ services, to access health-related data from diverse
        vendors’ CGM platforms and Electronic Health Record (EHR). Furthermore, other
        health-related data like physical activities, quality of life or well-being
        is often discussed but rarely stored inside the EHR system. We propose a future-proof
        architecture for diabetes medical consultation using the HL7 Fast Healthcare

      abstract: Evidence-based learning systems built on prediction models can support
        wound care community nurses (WCCNs) during diabetic foot ulcer care sessions.
        Several prediction models in the area of diabetic foot ulcer healing have
        been developed, most built on cardiovascular measurement data. Two other data
        types are patient information (i.e. sex and hemoglobin A1c) and wound characteristics
        (i.e. wound area and wound duration); these data relate to the status of the
        diabetic foot ulcer and are easily accessible for WCCNs. The aim of the study
        was to assess simple bedside wound characteristics for a prediction model
        for diabetic foot ulcer outcomes.Twenty predictor variables were tested. A
        pattern prediction model was used to forecast whether a given diabetic foot
        ulcer would (i) increase in size (or not) or (ii) decrease in size. Sensitivity,

      abstract: 'Background: Chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg
        ulcers, and pressure ulcers are a massive burden to health care facilities.
        Many randomized controlled trials on different wound care elements have been
        conducted and published in the Cochrane Library, all of which have only a
        low evidential basis. Thus, health care professionals are forced to rely on
        their own experience when making decisions regarding wound care. To progress
        from experience-based practice to evidence-based wound care practice, clinical
        decision support systems (CDSS) that help health care providers with decision-making
        in a clinical workflow have been developed. These systems have proven useful
        in many areas of the health care sector, partly because they have increased
        the quality of care, and partially because they have generated a solid basis
        for evidence-based practice. However, no systematic reviews focus on CDSS
        within the field of wound care to chronic wounds.Objective: The aims of this
        systematic literature review are (1) to identify models used in CDSS that
        support health care professionals treating chronic wounds, and (2) to classify

        or quantitative factors to measure or how to gather these reliable data.Objective:
        This study aimed to document the methods and both qualitative and quantitative

        study is to elucidate community nurses' professional basis for treating diabetic

        Danish community nursing setting. Experience is a crucial component in the
        community nurses' professional basis for treating diabetic foot ulcers. Peer-to-peer
        training is the prevailing way to learn about diabetic foot ulcer, however,
        this contributes to the risk of low evidence-based practice. Finally, a frequent
        behaviour among the community nurses is to consult colleagues before treating

      abstract: Clinical trial data collection still relies on a manual entry from
        information available in the medical record. This process introduces delay
        and error risk. Automating data transfer from Electronic Health Record (EHR)
        to Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, under investigators’ supervision,
        would gracefully solve these issues. The present paper describes the design
        of the evaluation of a technology allowing EHR to act as eSource for clinical
        trials. As part of the EHR2EDC project, for 6 ongoing clinical trials, running
        at 3 hospitals, a parallel semi-automated data collection using such technology
        will be conducted focusing on a limited scope of data (demographic data, local
        laboratory results, concomitant medication and vital signs). The evaluation
        protocol consists in an individual participant data prospective meta-analysis
        comparing regular clinical trial data collection to the semi-automated one.
        The main outcome is the proportion of data correctly entered. Data quality
        and associated workload for hospital staff will be compared as secondary outcomes.
        Results should be available in 2020.

      abstract: This paper explores the potential for use of an unaugmented commodity
        technology—the mobile phone—as a health promotion tool. We describe a prototype
        application that tracks the daily exercise activities of people, using an
        Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyse GSM cell signal strength and visibility
        to estimate a user’s movement. In a short-term study of the prototype that
        shared activity information amongst groups of friends, we found that awareness
        encouraged reflection on, and increased motivation for, daily activity. The
        study raised concerns regarding the reliability of ANN-facilitated activity
        detection in the ‘real world’. We describe some of the details of the pilot
        study and introduce a promising new approach to activity detection that has
        been developed in response to some of the issues raised by the pilot study,
        involving Hidden Markov Models (HMM), task modelling and unsupervised …

        a trial of 'Connecto', a phone based status and location sharing application
        that allows a group to 'tag' areas and have individuals' locations shared
        automatically on a mobile phone. In use the system moved beyond being an awareness
        tool to a way of continuing the ongoing 'story' of conversations within the
        group. Through sharing status and location the system supported each groups'
        ongoing repartee - a site for social exchange, enjoyment and friendship.

        the world and new technologies for mitigating spread, such as exposure notification
        applications and contact tracing, have been implemented in many countries.
        However, the uptake has differed from country to country and it has not been

        challenges which arise with hybrid work. Through cross-case analyses of published
        papers, we propose collocated distance as a design challenge uniquely relevant
        for hybrid cooperative technologies. We identify and conceptualize collocated
        distance as a design challenge that arises in hybrid work situations, where
        at least three actors are mutually dependent in their work while being located
        within fewer contexts than the number of actors. Collocated distance reminds
        us that when designing hybrid technologies, we must not only focus on creating

        pay attention to the relations and possible disconnections which exist locally

      abstract: Context-aware computing often involves tracking peoples’ location.
        Many studies and applications highlight the importance of keeping people’s
        location information private. We discuss two types of locationbased services;
        location-tracking services that are based on other parties tracking the user’s
        location and position-aware services that rely on the device’s knowledge of
        its own location. We present an experimental case study that examines people’s
        concern for location privacy and compare this to the use of location-based
        services. We find that even though the perceived usefulness of the two different
        types of services is the same, locationtracking services generate more concern
        for privacy than posit ion-aware services. We conclude that development emphasis
        should be given to position-aware services but that location-tracking services
        have a potential for success if users are given a simple option for turning
        the location-tracking off.

        to urban density. This is an old debate, originated in mid 19th century’s
        England with the emergence of public health and urban planning disciplines.
        While popularly linked, evidence suggests that such relationship cannot be
        generally assumed. Furthermore, urban density has been investigated in a spatially
        coarse manner (predominantly at city level) and never contextualised with
        other descriptors of urban form. In this work, we explore COVID-19 and urban

        and observed that the temporal trace of their migrations is compatible with
        a phenomenon of social influence, as described by a compartmental epidemic
        model of information diffusion. Drawing from prior research on behavioral
        change, we delved into the factors that account for variations across different
        Twitter communities in the effectiveness of the spreading of the influence
        to migrate. Communities in which the influence process unfolded more rapidly
        exhibit lower density of social connections, higher levels of signaled commitment
        to migrating, and more emphasis on shared identity and exchange of factual
        knowledge in the community discussion. These factors account collectively
        for 57% of the variance in the observed data. Our results highlight the joint
        importance of network structure, commitment, and psycho-linguistic aspects
        of social interactions in describing grassroots collective action, and contribute
        to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving processes of behavior
        change of online groups.

        new perspective on interaction design. From this perspective, the behavioral
        complexity should be understood as the underlying algorithms in the computational

        computational materials to adapt and come to life through interaction. We
        propose that behavioral complexity contributes to creating expressive complexity

      abstract: Experiments in innovation, design, and democracy that search not for
        a killer app but for a collaboratively created sustainable future.Innovation
        and design need not be about the search for a killer app. Innovation and design
        can start in people's everyday activities. They can encompass local services,
        cultural production, arenas for public discourse, or technological platforms.
        The approach is participatory, collaborative, and engaging, with users and
        consumers acting as producers and creators. It is concerned less with making
        new things than with making a socially sustainable future. This book describes
        experiments in innovation, design, and democracy, undertaken largely by grassroots
        organizations, non-governmental organizations, and multi-ethnic working-class
        neighborhoods.These stories challenge the dominant perception of what constitutes
        successful innovations. They recount efforts at social innovation, opening
        the production process, challenging the creative class, and expanding the
        public sphere. The wide range of cases considered include a collective of
        immigrant women who perform collaborative services, the development of an
        open-hardware movement, grassroots journalism, and hip-hop performances on
        city buses. They point to the possibility of democratized innovation that
        goes beyond solo entrepreneurship and crowdsourcing in the service of corporations
        to include multiple futures imagined and made locally by often-marginalized
        publics. ContributorsMåns Adler, Erling Björgvinsson, Karin Book, David Cuartielles,

      abstract: Employing student-driven project work in a higher education setting
        challenges not only the way in which we understand students’ learning and
        how we define the expected learning outcomes, it also challenges our ways
        of assessing students’ learning. This paper will address this question specifically
        and illustrate with a case that highlights some of the challenges that may
        arise in practice when assessing student-driven, problem-based projects. The
        case involved an assessment situation in which a discrepancy arose between
        the internal and external examiner in relation to what was valued. The discrepancy
        had consequences not only for the concrete assessment of students’ work, but
        also for the validity of the problem-based university pedagogy in general,
        and it raised the question of how to assess students’ work adequately. The
        research focus of this study was to explore the implications of assessing
        student-driven projects within a progressive approach to higher education
        teaching, along with the potential underlying issues. We found a need for
        clear assessment criteria while insisting on a space for students’ creativity
        and reflexivity as essential parts of a learning process. The paper thus makes
        a case for the notion of reflexivity as an assessment criterion to be integrated
        into learning objectives.

        within interaction design academia. It extends the Homo Ludens view of humans
        as playful creatures with the perspective of exploratory interaction. It focuses
        on socially exploratory interaction between participants mediated through
        designed artifacts. In the form of a Manifesto, four aspects are introduced
        which highlight important design dimensions to consider in Designing for Homo
        Explorens. The four aspects of the Manifesto are concerned with creating exploration
        through internal complexity, experiential exploration through full-body interaction,
        social playfulness through distortions of situated norms and a frame for performative
        interactions. The insights in the four aspects come from knowledge gained
        through experimenting with twelve working prototypes in real-life contexts,
        combined with contemporary streams of theory regarding ambiguity, somaesthetics,
        norms, situatedness and performativity.

        networks in urban areas to prevent environmental issues as well as to reduce
        the cost of fulfilling the energy demand. First, the energy consumption profile
        of the batteries of UAVs is estimated. Afterwards, the impact of the PV system
        sizing and battery capacity are studied based on sensitivity analysis.

        in order to take the transient stability of DGs into account is one of the
        major issues in power systems. Especially when the penetration of DGs is low,
        the impacts of them on the distribution system transient stability may be
        neglected. However, when the penetration of DG increases, the transient stability
        of them must be taken into account (more DGs, more transient issues). To this
        end, the DFR problem has been solve by an enhanced Gravitational Search Algorithm
        (EGSA) to improve the transient stability index and decrease losses and operation
        cost in a distribution test system with multiple micro-turbines. The effectiveness
        of the proposed approach is studied based on a typical 33-bus test system.

        to the zero-sum balance between energy harvested, stored, and consumed during

      abstract: The Giant Sunfish (Mola alexandrini) has unique patterns on its body,
        which allow for individual identification. By continuously gathering and matching
        images, it is possible to monitor and track individuals across location and
        time. However, matching images manually is a tedious and time-consuming task.
        To automate the process, we propose a pipeline based on finding and matching
        keypoints between image pairs. We evaluate our pipeline with four different
        keypoint descriptors, namely ORB, SIFT, RootSIFT, and SuperPoint, and demonstrate
        that the number of matching keypoints between a pair of images is a strong
        indicator for the likelihood that they contain the same individual. The best
        results are obtained with RootSIFT, which achieves an mAP of 75.91% on our
        test dataset (TinyMola+) without training or fine-tuning any parts of the
        pipeline. Furthermore, we show that the pipeline generalizes to other domains,
        such as re-identification of seals and cows. Lastly, we discuss the impracticality
        of a ranking-based output for real-life tasks and propose an alternative approach
        by viewing re-identification as a binary classification. We show that the
        pipeline can be easily modified with minimal fine-tuning to provide a binary
        output with a precision of 98% and recall of 44% on the TinyMola+ dataset,
        which basically eliminates the need for time-consuming manual verification
        on nearly half the dataset.

      abstract: The increasing demand for marine monitoring calls for robust automated
        systems to support researchers in gathering information from marine ecosystems.
        This includes computer vision based marine organism detection and species
        classification systems. Current state-of-the-art marine vision systems are
        based on CNNs, which in nature require a relatively large amount of varied
        training data. In this paper we present a new publicly available underwater
        dataset with annotated image sequences of fish, crabs, and starfish captured
        in brackish water with varying visibility. The dataset is called the Brackish
        Dataset and it is the first part of a planned long term monitoring of the
        marine species visiting the strait where the cameras are permanently mounted.
        To the best of our knowledge, this is the first annotated underwater image
        dataset captured in temperate brackish waters. In order to obtain a baseline
        performance for future reference, the YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 CNNs were fine-tuned
        and tested on the Brackish Dataset.

      abstract: 'In this work we present a novel publicly available stereo based 3D
        RGB dataset for multi-object zebrafish tracking, called 3D-ZeF. Zebrafish
        is an increasingly popular model organism used for studying neurological disorders,
        drug addiction, and more. Behavioral analysis is often a critical part of
        such research. However, visual similarity, occlusion, and erratic movement
        of the zebrafish makes robust 3D tracking a challenging and unsolved problem.
        The proposed dataset consists of eight sequences with a duration between 15-120
        seconds and 1-10 free moving zebrafish. The videos have been annotated with
        a total of 86,400 points and bounding boxes. Furthermore, we present a complexity
        score and a novel open-source modular baseline system for 3D tracking of zebrafish.
        The performance of the system is measured with respect to two detectors: a
        naive approach and a Faster R-CNN based fish head detector. The system reaches
        a MOTA of up to 77.6%. Links to the code and dataset is available at the project

      abstract: Sewer pipe inspections are currently conducted by professionals who
        remotely control a robot from above ground. This expensive and slow approach
        is prone to human mistakes. Therefore, there is both an economic and scientific
        interest in automating the inspection process by creating systems able to
        recognize sewer defects. However, the extent of research put into automatic
        water level estimation in sewers has been limited despite being a prerequisite
        for further analysis of the pipe as only sections above the water level can
        be visually inspected. In this work, we utilize a dataset of still images
        obtained from over 5000 inspections carried out for three different Danish
        water utilities companies. This dataset is used for training and testing decision
        tree methods and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic water
        level estimation. We pose the estimation problem as a classification and regression
        problem, and compare the results of both approaches. Furthermore, we compare
        the effect of using different inspection standards for labeling the ground
        truth water level. By treating the problem as a classification task and using
        the 2015 Danish sewer inspection standard, where water levels are clustered
        based on visual appearance, we achieve an averaged F1 score of 79.29% using
        a fine-tuned ResNet-50 CNN. This shows the potential of using CNNs for water
        level estimation. We believe including temporal and contextual information
        will improve the results further.

      abstract: There exist no publicly available annotated underwater multi-object
        tracking (MOT) datasets captured in turbid environments. To remedy this we
        propose the BrackishMOT dataset with focus on tracking schools of small fish,
        which is a notoriously difficult MOT task. BrackishMOT consists of 98 sequences
        captured in the wild. Alongside the novel dataset, we present baseline results
        by training a state-of-the-art tracker. Additionally, we propose a framework
        for creating synthetic sequences in order to expand the dataset. The framework
        consists of animated fish models and realistic underwater environments. We
        analyse the effects of including synthetic data during training and show that

      abstract: 'Accurately estimating the 3D position of underwater objects is of
        great interest when doing research on marine animals. An inherent problem
        of 3D reconstruction of underwater positions is the presence of refraction
        which invalidates the assumption of a single viewpoint. Three ways of performing
        3D reconstruction on underwater objects are compared in this work: an approach
        relying solely on in-air camera calibration, an approach with the camera calibration
        performed under water and an approach based on ray tracing with Snell''s law.
        As expected, the in-air camera calibration showed to be the most inaccurate
        as it does not take refraction into account. The precision of the estimated
        3D positions based on the underwater camera calibration and the ray tracing
        based approach were, on the other hand, almost identical. However, the ray
        tracing based approach is found to be advantageous as it is far more flexible
        in terms of the calibration procedure due to the decoupling of the intrinsic
        and extrinsic camera parameters.'

      abstract: Zebrafish are widely used for drug development and behavioral pattern
        studies. The currently employed zebrafish re-identification methods rely solely
        on top-view and grayscale images which require a significant amount of annotated
        data in order to perform well. In this paper, for the first time, we perform
        zebrafish re-identification using RGB images recorded from a side-view perspective,
        while keeping the amount of data annotation to a minimum. Inspired by the
        person re-identification field, two feature descriptors are tested, each encoding
        both color and texture information, and five metric and subspace learning
        methods. The contribution of the color and texture components of the feature
        descriptors were also investigated. We present and evaluate on a novel publicly
        available dataset of six zebrafish, recorded in a laboratory setup. The results
        show that a mean average precision of 99% can be achieved by using just 15
        annotated samples per fish. This approach shows a clear potential for incorporating
        the side-view information in the field of zebrafish tracking, as well as a
        clear argument for utilizing the color information of the zebrafish.

        or rulers that are overrepresented in images of malignant lesions. In this
        paper, we encounter text and calipers placed on the images found in national
        databases containing fetal screening ultrasound scans, which correlate with
        standard planes to be predicted. In order to utilize the vast amounts of data
        available in these databases, we develop and validate a series of methods
        for minimizing the confounding effects of embedded text and calipers on deep
        learning algorithms designed for ultrasound, using standard plane classification
        as a test case.

      abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) include a bottleneck of human-interpretable
        concepts providing explainability and intervention during inference by correcting
        the predicted, intermediate concepts. This makes CBMs attractive for high-stakes
        decision-making. In this paper, we take the quality assessment of fetal ultrasound
        scans as a real-life use case for CBM decision support in healthcare. For
        this case, simple binary concepts are not sufficiently reliable, as they are
        mapped directly from images of highly variable quality, for which variable
        model calibration might lead to unstable binarized concepts. Moreover, scalar
        concepts do not provide the intuitive spatial feedback requested by users.
        To address this, we design a hierarchical CBM imitating the sequential expert
        decision-making process of "seeing", "conceiving" and "concluding". Our model
        first passes through a layer of visual, segmentation-based concepts, and next
        a second layer of property concepts directly associated with the decision-making
        task. We note that experts can intervene on both the visual and property concepts
        during inference. Additionally, we increase the bottleneck capacity by considering
        task-relevant concept interaction. Our application of ultrasound scan quality
        assessment is challenging, as it relies on balancing the (often poor) image
        quality against an assessment of the visibility and geometric properties of
        standardized image content. Our validation shows that -- in contrast with
        previous CBM models -- our CBM models actually outperform equivalent concept-free
        models in terms of predictive performance. Moreover, we illustrate how interventions
        can further …

        quantifying structures such as vessels, airways, neurons, or organ boundaries
        in 2D slices. Segmentation via pixel-wise classification often fails to capture
        the small and low-contrast curvilinear structures. Prior topological information

        topological information from the coarse prediction by employing a triplet

      abstract: Standard spatial convolutions assume input data with a regular neighborhood
        structure. Existing methods typically generalize convolution to the irregular
        point cloud domain by fixing a regular “view” through e.g. a fixed neighborhood
        size, where the convolution kernel size remains the same for each point. However,
        since point clouds are not as structured as images, the fixed neighbor number
        gives an unfortunate inductive bias. We present a novel graph convolution
        named Difference Graph Convolution (diffConv), which does not rely on a regular
        view. diffConv operates on spatially-varying and density-dilated neighborhoods,
        which are further adapted by a learned masked attention mechanism. Experiments

        for rotating machinery (RM) based on a novel continuous wavelet transform-local
        binary convolutional neural network (CWT-LBCNN) model. The proposed approach
        builds an end-to-end diagnosis mechanism, and does not need manual feature
        extraction. By feeding the inputting vibration signal, features are captured
        adaptively and fault condition of RM is diagnosed automatically. Different
        from traditional CNNs, the proposed CWT-LBCNN utilizes a local binary convolution
        layer to replace a traditional convolution layer, which enables CWT-LBCNN
        to have faster training speed and less proneness to overfitting. Two experimental
        studies including bearing fault diagnosis and gearbox compound fault diagnosis

      abstract: 'In fetal ultrasound screening, Doppler images on the umbilical artery
        (UA) are important for monitoring blood supply through the umbilical cord.
        However, to capture UA Doppler images, a number of steps need to be done correctly:
        placing the gate at a proper location in the ultrasound image to obtain blood
        flow waveforms, and judging the Doppler waveform quality. Both of these rely
        on the operator''s experience. The shortage of experienced sonographers thus
        creates a demand for machine assistance. We propose an automatic system to
        fill this gap. Using a modified Faster R-CNN we obtain an algorithm that suggests
        Doppler flow gate locations. We subsequently assess the Doppler waveform quality.
        We validate the proposed system on 657 scans from a national ultrasound screening

        guiding operators for UA Doppler image capture and quality assessment.'

      abstract: Diffusion MRI fiber tractography is widely used to probe the structural
        connectivity of the brain, with a range of applications in both clinical and
        basic neuroscience. Despite widespread use, tractography has well-known pitfalls
        that limits the anatomical accuracy of this technique. Numerous modern methods
        have been developed to address these shortcomings through advances in acquisition,
        modeling, and computation. To test whether these advances improve tractography
        accuracy, we organized the 3-D Validation of Tractography with Experimental
        MRI (3D-VoTEM) challenge at the ISBI 2018 conference. We made available three
        unique independent tractography validation datasets – a physical phantom and
        two ex vivo brain specimens - resulting in 176 distinct submissions from 9
        research groups. By comparing results over a wide range of fiber complexities

        Diffusion MRI (dMRI) allows non-invasive estimation of axon radius, but accurately
        estimating the radius of axons in the human brain is challenging. Most axons
        in the brain have a radius below one micrometer, which falls below the sensitivity

        Therefore, new MRI methods that are sensitive to small axon radii are needed.
        In this proof-of-concept investigation, we examine whether a surface-based

      abstract: White matter bundle segmentation using diffusion MRI fiber tractography
        has become the method of choice to identify white matter fiber pathways in
        vivo in human brains. However, like other analyses of complex data, there
        is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This
        can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter
        pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and

        A unique in vivo human diffusion-T1-T2 relaxation dataset was acquired on
        a 3T MRI scanner with ultra-strong diffusion gradients, using a strong diffusion-weighting
        (i.e., b=6000 s/mm2) and multiple inversion and echo times. A second reduced
        diffusion-T2 dataset was collected at various echo times to evaluate the model
        further. The intra-axonal relaxation times were estimated by fitting a diffusion-relaxation
        model to the orientation-averaged spherical mean signals. Our analysis revealed
        that the proposed surface-based relaxation model effectively explains the
        relationship between the estimated relaxation times and the histological axon
        radius measured in various corpus callosum regions. Using these histological
        values, we developed a novel calibration approach to predict axon radius in
        other areas of the corpus callosum. Notably, the predicted radii and those

      abstract: We enable the estimation of the per-axon axial diffusivity from single
        encoding, strongly diffusion-weighted, pulsed gradient spin echo data. Additionally,
        we improve the estimation of the per-axon radial diffusivity compared to estimates
        based on spherical averaging. The use of strong diffusion weightings in magnetic
        resonance imaging (MRI) allows to approximate the signal in white matter as
        the sum of the contributions from only axons. At the same time, spherical
        averaging leads to a major simplification of the modeling by removing the
        need to explicitly account for the unknown distribution of axonal orientations.
        However, the spherically averaged signal acquired at strong diffusion weightings
        is not sensitive to the axial diffusivity, which cannot therefore be estimated
        although needed for modeling axons — especially in the context of multi-compartmental
        modeling. We introduce a new general method for the …

        (MR) signals is challenging but has high potential as it provides biomarkers
        characterizing the tissue micro-structure, such as the myelin water fraction

        the outputs with a priori knowledge of in vivo distributions. The proposed

        white matter orientation with micron resolution in cleared murine brains.
        Light-sheet elastic scattering microscopy (LSSM) can be used to exploit the
        scattering signal exhibited by white matter fibres, which is dependent on
        their orientation. The rotation and imaging of the sample yield a scattering
        profile, which corresponds to that of infinitely long cylinders. Our work
        combines two orthogonal acquisitions to voxel-wise reconstruct 3D-fibre orientations
        in large brain volumes. LSSM could be the definitive validation method for
        diffusion MRI orientation methods.

        to gain insight into the causes of attrition for patients in an electronic
        health (eHealth) intervention for chronic lifestyle diseases and evaluate
        if attrition can be predicted and consequently prevented. We aimed to build
        predictive models that can identify patients in a digital lifestyle intervention
        at high risk of dropout by analyzing several predictor variables applied in
        different models and to further assess the possibilities and impact of implementing
        such models into an eHealth platform.Data from 2684 patients using an eHealth
        platform were iteratively analyzed using logistic regression, decision trees,
        and random forest models. The dataset was split into a 79.99% (2147/2684)

        For this purpose, historical cumulative numbers of confirmed cases for three

        of children as part of the detection of hormonal problems and genetic disorders.
        The determination of skeletal maturity is done based on a radiological examination
        of the hand-wrist skeletal area. This paper introduces a novel approach for
        BAA that utilizes a histogram based comparison technique. This approach is
        executed as a web based system that uses an image repository and similarity
        measures based on content-based image retrieval. This study aims to overcome
        to the limitations of traditional methods utilized to estimate human age which
        were often imprecise. The system provides age prediction for hand and wrist
        x-ray images up till age of 18 years. The results of the system evaluation
        indicate this method as a reliable method for BAA with the error rates of-0.170625
        years compared with BoneXpert system that have returned error rate of between
        Â±0.46 to Â±0.37 years.

      abstract: Prediction of length of stay (LOS) at admission time can provide physicians
        and nurses insight into the illness severity of patients and aid them in avoiding
        adverse events and clinical deterioration. It also assists hospitals with
        more effectively managing their resources and manpower.In this field of research,
        there are some important challenges, such as missing values and LOS data skewness.
        Moreover, various studies use a binary classification which puts a wide range
        of patients with different conditions into one category. To address these
        shortcomings, first multivariate imputation techniques are applied to fill
        incomplete records, then two proper resampling techniques, namely Borderline-SMOTE
        and SMOGN, are applied to address data skewness in the classification and
        regression domains, respectively. Finally, machine learning …

      abstract: Bone age assessment (BAA) of unknown people is one of the most important
        topics in clinical procedure for evaluation of biological maturity of children.
        BAA is performed usually by comparing an X-ray of left hand wrist with an
        atlas of known sample bones. Recently, BAA has gained remarkable ground from
        academia and medicine. Manual methods of BAA are time-consuming and prone
        to observer variability. This is a motivation for developing automated methods
        of BAA. However, there is considerable research on the automated assessment,
        much of which are still in the experimental stage. This survey provides taxonomy
        of automated BAA approaches and discusses the challenges. Finally, we present
        suggestions for future research.

      abstract: The use of medical simulators for training technical and diagnostic
        skills has rapidly increased over the past decade. Yet, most available medical
        simulators have not been developed based on a structured evaluation of their
        intended uses but rather out of expected commercial value. Moreover, educators
        often struggle to access simulators because of cost or because no simulators
        have been developed for a particular procedure. In this report, we introduce
        “the V-model” as a conceptual framework to illustrate how simulator development
        can be guided by the intended uses in an iterative fashion. Applying a needs-based
        conceptual framework when developing simulators is important to increase the
        accessibility and sustainability of simulation-based medical education. It
        will minimize the developmental barriers and costs, while at the same time
        improving educational outcomes. Two new simulators for invasive …

      abstract: Neurotransmitter receptors modulate signaling between neurons. Thus,
        neurotransmitter receptors and transporters play a key role in shaping brain
        function. Due to the lack of comprehensive neurotransmitter receptor/transporter
        density datasets, microarray gene expression measuring mRNA transcripts is
        often used as a proxy for receptor densities. In the present report, we comprehensively
        test the spatial correlation between gene expression and protein density for
        a total of 27 neurotransmitter receptors, receptor binding-sites, and transporters
        across 9 different neurotransmitter systems, using both PET and autoradiography
        radioligand-based imaging modalities. We find poor spatial correspondences
        between gene expression and density for all neurotransmitter receptors and
        transporters except four single-protein metabotropic receptors (5-HT 1 A,
        CB 1, D 2, and MOR). These expression-density associations …

        normative atlas of 19 receptors and transporters across nine different neurotransmitter
        systems. We found that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity
        and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and

      abstract: 'If bone is considered as a composite of collagen (protein) and bioapatite

        deterioration of the organic phase; (2) chemical deterioration of the mineral
        phase; and (3) (micro) biological attack of the composite. The first of these
        three pathways is relatively unusual and will only occur in environments that
        are geochemically stable for bone mineral. However, because rates of biomolecular

        biomolecular information. In most environments, bones are not in thermodynamic
        equilibrium with the soil solution, and undergo chemical deterioration (path

      abstract: Claims of extreme survival of DNA have emphasized the need for reliable
        models of DNA degradation through time. By analysing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
        from 158 radiocarbon-dated bones of the extinct New Zealand moa, we confirm
        empirically a long-hypothesized exponential decay relationship. The average
        DNA half-life within this geographically constrained fossil assemblage was
        estimated to be 521 years for a 242 bp mtDNA sequence, corresponding to a
        per nucleotide fragmentation rate (k) of 5.50 × 10–6 per year. With an effective
        burial temperature of 13.1°C, the rate is almost 400 times slower than predicted
        from published kinetic data of in vitro DNA depurination at pH 5. Although
        best described by an exponential model (R2 = 0.39), considerable sample-to-sample
        variance in DNA preservation could not be accounted for by geologic age. This
        variation likely derives from differences in taphonomy …

      abstract: Leather was one of the most important materials of nomadic Scythians,
        used for clothing, shoes, and quivers, amongst other objects. However, our
        knowledge regarding the specific animal species used in Scythian leather production
        remains limited.In this first systematic study, we used palaeoproteomics methods
        to analyse the species in 45 samples of leather and two fur objects recovered
        from 18 burials excavated at 14 different Scythian sites in southern Ukraine.
        Our results demonstrate that Scythians primarily used domesticated species
        such as sheep, goat, cattle, and horse for the production of leather, while
        the furs were made of wild animals such as fox, squirrel and feline species.
        The surprise discovery is the presence of two human skin samples, which for
        the first time provide direct evidence of the Greek historian Herodotus’ claim
        that Scythians used the skin of their dead enemies to manufacture leather
        trophy items, such as quiver covers. We argue that leather manufacture is
        not incompatible with a nomadic lifestyle and that Scythians possessed sophisticated
        leather production technologies that ensured stable supply of this essential
        material.

      abstract: In 2018, a well-constructed cist-type grave was discovered at Ba`ja,
        a Neolithic village (7,400–6,800 BCE) in Southern Jordan. Underneath multiple
        grave layers, an 8-year-old child was buried in a fetal position. Over 2,500
        beads were found on the chest and neck, along with a double perforated stone
        pendant and a delicately engraved mother-of-pearl ring discovered among the
        concentration of beads. The first was found behind the neck, and the second
        on the chest. The meticulous documentation of the bead distribution indicated
        that the assemblage was a composite ornament that had gradually collapsed,
        partly due to the burying position. Our aim was to challenge time degradation
        and to reimagine the initial composition in order to best explore the significance
        of this symbolic category of material culture, not as mere group of beads,
        but as an ornamental creation with further aesthetic, artisanal and socioeconomic
        implications. The reconstruction results exceeded our expectations as it revealed
        an imposing multi-row necklace of complex structure and attractive design.
        Through multiple lines of evidence, we suggest that the necklace was created
        at Ba`ja, although significant parts of beads were made from exotic shells
        and stones, including fossil amber, an unprecedented material never attested
        before for this period. The retrieval of such an ornament from life and its
        attribution to a young dead child highlights the significant social status
        of this individual. Beyond the symbolic functions related to identity, the
        necklace is believed to have played a key role in performing the inhumation
        rituals, understood as a public event gathering families …

      abstract: Taxonomic identification of whale bones found during archaeological
        excavations is problematic due to their typically fragmented state. This difficulty
        limits understanding of both the past spatio-temporal distributions of whale
        populations and of possible early whaling activities. To overcome this challenge,
        we performed zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry on an unprecedented 719 archaeological
        and palaeontological specimens of probable whale bone from Atlantic European
        contexts, predominantly dating from ca 3500 BCE to the eighteenth century
        CE. The results show high numbers of Balaenidae (many probably North Atlantic
        right whale (Eubalaena glacialis)) and grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus)
        specimens, two taxa no longer present in the eastern North Atlantic. This

        right whales, but was unanticipated for grey whales, which …

      abstract: Clovis, with its distinctive biface, blade and osseous technologies,
        is the oldest widespread archaeological complex defined in North America,
        dating from 11,100 to 10,700 14C years before present (bp) (13,000 to 12,600
        calendar years bp),. Nearly 50 years of archaeological research point to the
        Clovis complex as having developed south of the North American ice sheets
        from an ancestral technology. However, both the origins and the genetic legacy
        of the people who manufactured Clovis tools remain under debate. It is generally
        believed that these people ultimately derived from Asia and were directly
        related to contemporary Native Americans. An alternative, Solutrean, hypothesis

      abstract: The Neolithic burial of Grotta di Pietra Sant’Angelo (CS) represents
        a unique archaeological finding for the prehistory of Southern Italy. The
        unusual placement of the inhumation at a rather high altitude and far from
        inhabited areas, the lack of funerary equipment and the prone deposition of
        the body find limited similarities in coeval Italian sites. These elements
        have prompted wider questions on mortuary customs during the prehistory of
        Southern Italy. This atypical case requires an interdisciplinary approach
        aimed to build an integrated bioarchaeological profile of the individual.
        The paleopathological investigation of the skeletal remains revealed the presence
        of numerous markers that could be associated with craft activities, suggesting
        possible interpretations of the individual’s lifestyle. CT analyses, carried
        out on the maxillary bones, showed the presence of a peculiar type of dental
        wear, but also a good density of …

      abstract: Projections of West African Monsoon (WAM) precipitation are uncertain.
        To address this, an improved understanding of the mechanisms driving WAM precipitation
        change is needed to shed light on inter-model differences and aid model development.
        The full forcing of increased CO 2 can be decomposed into different components
        such as the impact of ocean warming, or the direct radiative effect of increased
        CO 2. This paper investigates such a decomposition, analysing the effect of
        a uniform 4K ocean warming whilst keeping atmospheric CO 2 concentrations
        constant. The analysis highlights several mechanisms acting to decrease WAM
        precipitation over a range of timescales, from days after the abrupt ocean
        warming, to the long-term equilibrium response. The initial decrease in WAM
        precipitation is caused by warming and enhanced convection over the ocean,
        stabilising the atmosphere inland and disrupting …

        especially for non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first
        NLP dataset for TikTok comments and the first Danish social media dataset
        with part-of-speech annotation. We further supply annotations for normalization,
        code-switching, and annotator uncertainty. As transferring models to such
        a highly specialized domain is non-trivial, we conduct an extensive study
        into which source data and modeling decisions most impact the performance.
        Surprisingly, transferring from in-domain data, even from a different language,
        outperforms in-language, out-of-domain training. These benefits nonetheless
        rely on the underlying language models having been at least partially pre-trained
        on data from the target language. Using our additional annotation layers,
        we further analyze how normalization, code-switching, and human uncertainty
        affect the tagging accuracy.

      abstract: With the increase in availability of large pre-trained language models
        (LMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP), it becomes critical to assess
        their fit for a specific target task a priori - as fine-tuning the entire
        space of available LMs is computationally prohibitive and unsustainable. However,
        encoder transferability estimation has received little to no attention in
        NLP. In this paper, we propose to generate quantitative evidence to predict
        which LM, out of a pool of models, will perform best on a target task without
        having to fine-tune all candidates. We provide a comprehensive study on LM
        ranking for 10 NLP tasks spanning the two fundamental problem types of classification
        and structured prediction. We adopt the state-of-the-art Logarithm of Maximum
        Evidence (LogME) measure from Computer Vision (CV) and find that it positively
        correlates with final LM performance in 94% of the setups. In the first study
        of its kind, we further compare transferability measures with the de facto
        standard of human practitioner ranking, finding that evidence from quantitative
        metrics is more robust than pure intuition and can help identify unexpected
        LM candidates.

      abstract: Linguistic information is encoded at varying timescales (subwords,
        phrases, etc.) and communicative levels, such as syntax and semantics. Contextualized
        embeddings have analogously been found to capture these phenomena at distinctive
        layers and frequencies. Leveraging these findings, we develop a fully learnable
        frequency filter to identify spectral profiles for any given task. It enables
        vastly more granular analyses than prior handcrafted filters, and improves
        on efficiency. After demonstrating the informativeness of spectral probing
        over manual filters in a monolingual setting, we investigate its multilingual
        characteristics across seven diverse NLP tasks in six languages. Our analyses
        identify distinctive spectral profiles which quantify cross-task similarity
        in a linguistically intuitive manner, while remaining consistent across languages-highlighting
        their potential as robust, lightweight task descriptors.

      abstract: Making an informed choice of pre-trained language model (LM) is critical
        for performance, yet environmentally costly, and as such widely underexplored.
        The field of Computer Vision has begun to tackle encoder ranking, with promising
        forays into Natural Language Processing, however they lack coverage of linguistic
        tasks such as structured prediction. We propose probing to rank LMs, specifically
        for parsing dependencies in a given language, by measuring the degree to which
        labeled trees are recoverable from an LM's contextualized embeddings. Across
        46 typologically and architecturally diverse LM-language pairs, our probing
        approach predicts the best LM choice 79% of the time using orders of magnitude
        less compute than training a full parser. Within this study, we identify and
        analyze one recently proposed decoupled LM - RemBERT - and find it strikingly
        contains less inherent dependency information, but often yields the best parser
        after full fine-tuning. Without this outlier our approach identifies the best
        LM in 89% of cases.

    mI392-4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC:
      abstract: Recent work has shown that monolingual masked language models learn
        to represent data-driven notions of language variation which can be used for
        domain-targeted training data selection. Dataset genre labels are already
        frequently available, yet remain largely unexplored in cross-lingual setups.
        We harness this genre metadata as a weak supervision signal for targeted data
        selection in zero-shot dependency parsing. Specifically, we project treebank-level
        genre information to the finer-grained sentence level, with the goal to amplify
        information implicitly stored in unsupervised contextualized representations.
        We demonstrate that genre is recoverable from multilingual contextual embeddings
        and that it provides an effective signal for training data selection in cross-lingual,
        zero-shot scenarios. For 12 low-resource language treebanks, six of which
        are test-only, our genre-specific methods significantly outperform competitive
        baselines as well as recent embedding-based methods for data selection. Moreover,
        genre-based data selection provides new state-of-the-art results for three
        of these target languages.

        for several closely-related languages, but predicting the success in other
        cases remains hard. Our study is a comprehensive analysis of the impact of
        linguistic distance on the transfer of UD parsers. As an alternative to syntactic
        typological distances extracted from URIEL, we propose three text-based feature
        spaces and show that they can be more precise predictors, especially on a
        more local scale, when only shorter distances are taken into account. Our
        analyses also reveal that the good coverage in typological databases is not
        among the factors that explain good transfer.

      abstract: This work provides the first in-depth analysis of genre in Universal
        Dependencies (UD). In contrast to prior work on genre identification which
        uses small sets of well-defined labels in mono-/bilingual setups, UD contains
        18 genres with varying degrees of specificity spread across 114 languages.
        As most treebanks are labeled with multiple genres while lacking annotations
        about which instances belong to which genre, we propose four methods for predicting
        instance-level genre using weak supervision from treebank metadata. The proposed
        methods recover instance-level genre better than competitive baselines as
        measured on a subset of UD with labeled instances and adhere better to the
        global expected distribution. Our analysis sheds light on prior work using
        UD genre metadata for treebank selection, finding that metadata alone are
        a noisy signal and must be disentangled within treebanks before it can be
        universally applied.

      abstract: Probing has become an important tool for analyzing representations
        in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For graphical NLP tasks such as dependency
        parsing, linear probes are currently limited to extracting undirected or unlabeled
        parse trees which do not capture the full task. This work introduces DepProbe,
        a linear probe which can extract labeled and directed dependency parse trees
        from embeddings while using fewer parameters and compute than prior methods.
        Leveraging its full task coverage and lightweight parametrization, we investigate
        its predictive power for selecting the best transfer language for training
        a full biaffine attention parser. Across 13 languages, our proposed method
        identifies the best source treebank 94% of the time, outperforming competitive
        baselines and prior work. Finally, we analyze the informativeness of task-specific
        subspaces in contextual embeddings as well as which benefits a full parser's
        non-linear parametrization provides.

      abstract: The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system modulates many important

        Here, we present a high-resolution, multidimensional, in vivo atlas of four
        of the human brain's 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT4) and

        high-resolution neuroimaging data consisting of positron emission tomography
        (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired in a total of 210
        healthy individuals. Comparison of the regional PET binding measures with
        postmortem human brain autoradiography outcomes showed a high correlation
        for the five 5-HT targets and this enabled us to transform the atlas to represent
        protein densities (in picomoles per milliliter). We also assessed the regional

      abstract: Recent work on algorithmic fairness has largely focused on the fairness
        of discrete decisions, or classifications. While such decisions are often
        based on risk score models, the fairness of the risk models themselves has
        received considerably less attention. Risk models are of interest for a number
        of reasons, including the fact that they communicate uncertainty about the
        potential outcomes to users, thus representing a way to enable meaningful
        human oversight. Here, we address fairness desiderata for risk score models.
        We identify the provision of similar epistemic value to different groups as
        a key desideratum for risk score fairness, and we show how even fair risk
        scores can lead to unfair risk-based rankings. Further, we address how to
        assess the fairness of risk score models quantitatively, including a discussion
        of metric choices and meaningful statistical comparisons between groups. In
        this context, we also …

      abstract: Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer worldwide.
        However, this disease can be prevented by detection and removal of precursor
        adenomatous polyps during optical colonoscopy (OC). During OC, the endoscopist
        looks for colon polyps. While hyperplastic polyps are benign lesions, adenomatous
        polyps are likely to become cancerous. Hence, it is a common practice to remove
        all identified polyps and send them to subsequent histological analysis. But
        removal of hyperplastic polyps poses unnecessary risk to patients and incurs
        unnecessary costs for histological analysis. In this paper, we develop the
        first part of a novel optical biopsy application based on narrow-band imaging

      abstract: Efforts to develop neuroimaging-based biomarkers in major depressive
        disorder (MDD), at the individual level, have been limited to date. As diagnostic
        criteria are currently symptom-based, MDD is conceptualized as a disorder
        rather than a disease with a known etiology; further, neural measures are
        often confounded by medication status and heterogeneous symptom states. We
        describe a consortium to quantify neuroanatomical and neurofunctional heterogeneity
        via the dimensions of novel multivariate coordinate system (COORDINATE-MDD).
        Utilizing imaging harmonization and machine learning methods in a large cohort
        of medication-free, deeply phenotyped MDD participants, patterns of brain
        alteration are defined in replicable and neurobiologically-based dimensions

        group. This can occur due to a combination of group underrepresentation, modeling
        choices, and the characteristics of the prediction task at hand. We examine

      abstract: We show that the time evolution of an open quantum system, described
        by a possibly time dependent Liouvillian, can be simulated by a unitary quantum
        circuit of a size scaling polynomially in the simulation time and the size
        of the system. An immediate consequence is that dissipative quantum computing
        is no more powerful than the unitary circuit model. Our result can be seen
        as a dissipative Church-Turing theorem, since it implies that under natural
        assumptions, such as weak coupling to an environment, the dynamics of an open
        quantum system can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer. Formally,
        we introduce a Trotter decomposition for Liouvillian dynamics and give explicit
        error bounds. This constitutes a practical tool for numerical simulations,
        eg, using matrix-product operators. We also demonstrate that most quantum
        states cannot be prepared efficiently.

      abstract: Variational Monte Carlo with neural network quantum states has proven
        to be a promising avenue for evaluating the ground-state energy of spin Hamiltonians.
        However, despite continuous efforts the performance of the method on frustrated
        Hamiltonians remains significantly worse than those on stoquastic Hamiltonians
        that are sign free. We present a detailed and systematic study of restricted
        Boltzmann machine (RBM) based variational Monte Carlo for quantum spin chains,
        resolving how relevant stoquasticity is in this setting. We show that in most
        cases, when the Hamiltonian is phase connected with a stoquastic point, the
        complex RBM state can faithfully represent the ground state, and local quantities
        can be evaluated efficiently by sampling. On the other hand, we identify several
        new phases that are challenging for the RBM Ansatz, including nontopological
        robust nonstoquastic phases as well as stoquastic …

      abstract: Preparing ground states and thermal states is of key importance to
        simulating quantum systems on a quantum computer. Despite the hope for practical
        quantum advantage in quantum simulation, popular approaches like variational
        circuits or adiabatic algorithms appear to face serious difficulties. Monte-Carlo
        style quantum Gibbs samplers have emerged as an alternative, but prior proposals
        have been unsatisfactory due to technical obstacles related to energy-time
        uncertainty. We introduce simple continuous-time quantum Gibbs samplers that
        overcome these obstacles by efficiently simulating Nature-inspired quantum
        Master Equations (Liouvillians) utilizing the operator Fourier transform.
        In addition, we construct the first provably accurate and efficient algorithm
        for preparing certain purified Gibbs states (called thermal field double states
        in high-energy physics) of rapidly thermalizing systems; this algorithm also
        benefits from a Szegedy-type quadratic improvement with respect to the mixing
        time. Our algorithms' cost has a favorable dependence on temperature, accuracy,
        and the mixing time (or spectral gap) of the relevant Liouvillians. We contribute
        to the theory of thermalization by developing a general analytic framework
        that handles energy uncertainty through non-asymptotic secular approximation
        and approximate detailed balance, establishing our approximation guarantees
        and, as a byproduct yielding the first rigorous proof of finite-time thermalization
        for physically derived Liouvillians. Given the success of the classical Metropolis
        algorithm and the ubiquity of thermodynamics, we anticipate that quantum Gibbs
        sampling will become an …

      abstract: The simulation software for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron
        Collider is being used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing
        Grid. This simulation requires many components, from the generators that simulate
        particle collisions, through packages simulating the response of the various
        detectors and triggers. All of these components come together under the ATLAS
        simulation infrastructure. In this paper, that infrastructure is discussed,
        including that supporting the detector description, interfacing the event
        generation, and combining the GEANT4 simulation of the response of the individual
        detectors. Also described are the tools allowing the software validation,
        performance testing, and the validation of the simulated output against known
        physics processes.

      abstract: Risk assessment and in particular derivatives pricing is one of the
        core areas in computational finance and accounts for a sizeable fraction of
        the global computing resources of the financial industry. We outline a quantum-inspired
        algorithm for multi-asset options pricing. The algorithm is based on tensor
        networks, which have allowed for major conceptual and numerical breakthroughs
        in quantum many body physics and quantum computation. In the proof-of-concept
        example explored, the tensor network approach yields several orders of magnitude
        speedup over vanilla Monte Carlo simulations. We take this as good evidence
        that the use of tensor network methods holds great promise for alleviating
        the computation burden of risk evaluation in the financial and other industries,
        thus potentially lowering the carbon footprint these simulations incur today.

      abstract: Due to intense interest in the potential applications of quantum computing,
        it is critical to understand the basis for potential exponential quantum advantage
        in quantum chemistry. Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most
        common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation,
        for generic chemical problems where heuristic quantum state preparation might
        be assumed to be efficient. The availability of exponential quantum advantage
        then centers on whether features of the physical problem that enable efficient
        heuristic quantum state preparation also enable efficient solution by classical
        heuristics. Through numerical studies of quantum state preparation and empirical
        complexity analysis (including the error scaling) of classical heuristics,
        in both ab initio and model Hamiltonian settings, we conclude that evidence
        for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to …

      abstract: This work is concerned with thermal quantum states of Hamiltonians
        on spin-and fermionic-lattice systems with short-range interactions. We provide
        results leading to a local definition of temperature, thereby extending the
        notion of “intensivity of temperature” to interacting quantum models. More
        precisely, we derive a perturbation formula for thermal states. The influence
        of the perturbation is exactly given in terms of a generalized covariance.
        For this covariance, we prove exponential clustering of correlations above
        a universal critical temperature that upper bounds physical critical temperatures
        such as the Curie temperature. As a corollary, we obtain that above the critical
        temperature, thermal states are stable against distant Hamiltonian perturbations.
        Moreover, our results imply that above the critical temperature, local expectation
        values can be approximated efficiently in the error and the system size.

      abstract: We study a subclass of the Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time (IQP)
        circuit with a varying density of two-qubit gates. We identify two phase transitions
        as a function of the gate density. At the first transition, the coherent Gibbs
        representation of the output state transitions from quasilocal to extended,
        and becomes completely non-local after the second transition, resembling that
        of Haar random states. We introduce several new diagnostics to argue that
        learning the distribution after the first transition already becomes classically
        intractable, even though its output distribution is far from random. Our work
        thus opens a novel pathway for exploring quantum advantage in more practical
        setups whose outcome distributions are more structured than random states.

      abstract: We propose a novel scheme for the preparation of a maximally entangled
        state of two atoms in an optical cavity. Starting from an arbitrary initial
        state, a singlet state is prepared as the unique fixed point of a dissipative
        quantum dynamical process. In our scheme, cavity decay is no longer undesirable,
        but plays an integral part in the dynamics. As a result, we get a qualitative
        improvement in the scaling of the fidelity with the cavity parameters. Our
        analysis indicates that dissipative state preparation is more than just a
        new conceptual approach, but can allow for significant improvement as compared
        to preparation protocols based on coherent unitary dynamics.

        the negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense
        of passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due
        to computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached

        movement on the basis of large-scale mobility data from diverse cities around
        the globe. According to this law, the number of visitors to any location decreases

        distance. We further show that the spatio-temporal flows to different locations

      abstract: Sharing rides could drastically improve the efficiency of car and
        taxi transportation. Unleashing such potential, however, requires understanding
        how urban parameters affect the fraction of individual trips that can be shared,
        a quantity that we call shareability. Using data on millions of taxi trips
        in New York City, San Francisco, Singapore, and Vienna, we compute the shareability
        curves for each city, and find that a natural rescaling collapses them onto
        a single, universal curve. We explain this scaling law theoretically with
        a simple model that predicts the potential for ride sharing in any city, using
        a few basic urban quantities and no adjustable parameters. Accurate extrapolations
        of this type will help planners, transportation companies, and society at
        large to shape a sustainable path for urban growth.

      abstract: 'From a transport perspective, increasing active travel –and walking
        in particular– is crucial for the future of sustainable cities, as reflected
        in global decarbonisation policies and agendas. Further, walking is much more
        than a mere mode of transport: it provides a fundamental social function,
        fostering vibrant cohesive communities. Arguably, walking and its associated
        infrastructure –sidewalks– should rank among the highest priorities for planning
        authorities. However, efficiency- and speed-driven urbanisation has gradually
        reallocated street space to private cars, leading to automobiles being the
        prioritised mode of transport today. Empirical research has generally followed
        suit, and a systemic understanding of walking as a phenomenon is largely missing,

      abstract: Quantification of human group-behavior has so far defied an empirical,
        falsifiable approach. This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition
        of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating
        new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting
        individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data
        set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of
        3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of
        a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single
        and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic
        activities to ‘survive’ and are typically engaged in a multitude of social
        activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files

      abstract: The capacity to collect fingerprints of individuals in online media
        has revolutionized the way researchers explore human society. Social systems
        can be seen as a nonlinear superposition of a multitude of complex social
        networks, where nodes represent individuals and links capture a variety of
        different social relations. Much emphasis has been put on the network topology
        of social interactions, however, the multidimensional nature of these interactions
        has largely been ignored, mostly because of lack of data. Here, for the first
        time, we analyze a complete, multirelational, large social network of a society
        consisting of the 300,000 odd players of a massive multiplayer online game.
        We extract networks of six different types of one-to-one interactions between
        the players. Three of them carry a positive connotation (friendship, communication,
        trade), three a negative (enmity, armed aggression, punishment). We first

      abstract: Latent space geometry has shown itself to provide a rich and rigorous
        framework for interacting with the latent variables of deep generative models.
        The existing theory, however, relies on the decoder being a Gaussian distribution
        as its simple reparametrization allows us to interpret the generating process
        as a random projection of a deterministic manifold. Consequently, this approach
        breaks down when applied to decoders that are not as easily reparametrized.
        We here propose to use the Fisher-Rao metric associated with the space of
        decoder distributions as a reference metric, which we pull back to the latent
        space. We show that we can achieve meaningful latent geometries for a wide
        range of decoder distributions for which the previous theory was not applicable,
        opening the door to `black box' latent geometries.

      abstract: Deep generative models can automatically create content of diverse
        types. However, there are no guarantees that such content will satisfy the
        criteria necessary to present it to end-users and be functional, e.g. the
        generated levels could be unsolvable or incoherent. In this paper we study
        this problem from a geometric perspective, and provide a method for reliable
        interpolation and random walks in the latent spaces of Categorical VAEs based
        on Riemannian geometry. We test our method with “Super Mario Bros” and “The
        Legend of Zelda” levels, and against simpler baselines inspired by current
        practice. Results show that the geometry we propose is better able to interpolate
        and sample, reliably staying closer to parts of the latent space that decode
        to playable content.

      abstract: Robotic taxonomies have appeared as high-level hierarchical abstractions
        that classify how humans move and interact with their environment. They have
        proven useful to analyse grasps, manipulation skills, and whole-body support
        poses. Despite the efforts devoted to design their hierarchy and underlying
        categories, their use in application fields remains scarce. This may be attributed
        to the lack of computational models that fill the gap between the discrete
        hierarchical structure of the taxonomy and the high-dimensional heterogeneous
        data associated to its categories. To overcome this problem, we propose to
        model taxonomy data via hyperbolic embeddings that capture the associated
        hierarchical structure. To do so, we formulate a Gaussian process hyperbolic
        latent variable model and enforce the taxonomy structure through graph-based
        priors on the latent space and distance-preserving back constraints. We test
        our model on the whole-body support pose taxonomy to learn hyperbolic embeddings
        that comply with the original graph structure. We show that our model properly
        encodes unseen poses from existing or new taxonomy categories, it can be used
        to generate trajectories between the embeddings, and it outperforms its Euclidean
        counterparts.

      abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a machine learning approach to learn a
        policy from a set of demonstrations. IL can be useful to kick-start learning
        before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its
        own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. Despite the success
        of systems that use IL and RL, how such systems can adapt in-between game
        rounds is a neglected area of study but an important aspect of many strategy
        games. In this paper, we present a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire
        Imitation Learning (BRIL) that learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set
        of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions.
        The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned
        on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach
        to train a policy on 7,777 human demonstrations for the build-order planning

      abstract: Methods for dynamic difficulty adjustment allow games to be tailored
        to particular players to maximize their engagement. However, current methods
        often only modify a limited set of game features such as the difficulty of
        the opponents, or the availability of resources. Other approaches, such as
        experience-driven Procedural Content Generation (PCG), can generate complete
        levels with desired properties such as levels that are neither too hard nor
        too easy, but require many iterations. This paper presents a method that can
        generate and search for complete levels with a specific target difficulty
        in only a few trials. This advance is enabled by through an Intelligent Trial-and-Error
        algorithm, originally developed to allow robots to adapt quickly. Our algorithm

        dimensions such as leniency or map coverage. The performance of an AI playing

      abstract: Automated generation of complex and diverse environments can be achieved
        through the use of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithms. However,
        generating content that is both meaningful and reflective of specific intentions
        and constraints remains a challenge. Recent advances in Large Language Models
        (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various domains. These models
        can be fine-tuned and information can be reused to accelerate training for
        new tasks. Our study presents MarioGPT, a fine-tuned GPT2 model that has been
        trained to generate tile-based game levels for Super Mario Bros. The results
        demonstrate that MarioGPT can generate diverse levels and can be text-prompted
        for controllable level generation, addressing a critical challenge in current
        PCG techniques.

      abstract: In nature, the process of cellular growth and differentiation has
        lead to an amazing diversity of organisms -- algae, starfish, giant sequoia,
        tardigrades, and orcas are all created by the same generative process. Inspired
        by the incredible diversity of this biological generative process, we propose
        a generative model, the Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), which
        is loosely inspired by the biological processes of cellular growth and differentiation.
        Unlike previous related works, the VNCA is a proper probabilistic generative
        model, and we evaluate it according to best practices. We find that the VNCA
        learns to reconstruct samples well and that despite its relatively few parameters
        and simple local-only communication, the VNCA can learn to generate a large
        variety of output from information encoded in a common vector format. While
        there is a significant gap to the current state-of-the-art in terms of generative
        modeling performance, we show that the VNCA can learn a purely self-organizing
        generative process of data. Additionally, we show that the VNCA can learn
        a distribution of stable attractors that can recover from significant damage.

        efficient Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior density of the NMF factors.
        On a chemical brain imaging data set, we show that this improves interpretability

        used for model order selection by estimating the marginal likelihood, and
        compare with the Bayesian information criterion. For computing the maximum

        their sensitivity. We then compare the algorithm with the classical spectral

      abstract: Labeling of multivariate biomedical time series data is a laborious
        and expensive process. Self-supervised contrastive learning alleviates the
        need for large, labeled datasets through pretraining on unlabeled data. However,
        for multivariate time series data the set of input channels often varies between
        applications, and most existing work does not allow for transfer between datasets
        with different sets of input channels. We propose learning one encoder to
        operate on all input channels individually. We then use a message passing
        neural network to extract a single representation across channels. We demonstrate
        the potential of this method by pretraining our network on a dataset with
        six EEG channels and finetuning on a dataset with two different EEG channels.
        We compare networks with and without the message passing neural network across
        different contrastive loss functions. We show that our method combined with
        the TS2Vec loss outperforms all other methods in most settings.

      abstract: In federated learning, data heterogeneity is a critical challenge.
        A straightforward solution is to shuffle the clients' data to homogenize the
        distribution. However, this may violate data access rights, and how and when
        shuffling can accelerate the convergence of a federated optimization algorithm
        is not theoretically well understood. In this paper, we establish a precise
        and quantifiable correspondence between data heterogeneity and parameters
        in the convergence rate when a fraction of data is shuffled across clients.
        We prove that shuffling can quadratically reduce the gradient dissimilarity
        with respect to the shuffling percentage, accelerating convergence. Inspired
        by the theory, we propose a practical approach that addresses the data access
        rights issue by shuffling locally generated synthetic data. The experimental
        results show that shuffling synthetic data improves the performance of multiple
        existing federated learning algorithms by a large margin.

      abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy techniques enable accurate chemical detection
        and quantification, but the extraction of spectral peak parameters is frequently
        hampered by an underlying baseline. Because the signal and baseline are additive,
        it is difficult to distinguish between signal peaks and baseline effects when
        the baseline is not smooth. Using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
        and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy as examples, we show how to estimate
        the signal and the baseline jointly while imposing a high-capacity non-stationary
        Gaussian process on the baseline. This allows us to both obtain accurate estimation
        and meaningful uncertainty estimates on interpretable peak parameters. We
        demonstrate this on artificially generated SERS maps, a challenging real-world
        SERS case, and a benchmark NIR dataset.

      abstract: Industrial robots have been widely used in diverse activities and
        industries for more than six decades. However, these robots were initially
        designed to operate autonomously without human interaction. The emergence
        of a new generation of manipulators, namely lightweight robots such as collaborative
        robots, has revolutionized the industry by enabling robots to work alongside
        humans. In this paper, we qualitatively compare the energy consumption of
        these two types of robots. First, we propose experimental setups to investigate
        how specific variables, such as standstill position, motion commands, velocity
        and acceleration limits, time scaling, and joint temperatures, influence the
        energy consumption of a cobot, namely, UR3e. Then, the cobot results are compared
        to IR experimental results which are mainly based on existing literature.
        The comparison reveals that the energy signature graph, which depicts the
        energy consumption versus execution time, differs between these two robots.
        Furthermore, industrial robots consume a considerably larger amount of mechanical
        energy compared to their electronic components' energy, while cobots consume
        a higher proportion of energy in their electronic components. Energy optimization
        strategies for cobots should focus on efficient electronic design, such as
        the distribution of computation tasks among system assets, rather than reducing
        energy consumption through motion planning.

      abstract: Compliance with global guidelines for sustainable and responsible
        production in modern industry requires a comparative analysis of consumer
        devices' energy consumption (EC). This also holds true for the newly established
        generation of lightweight industrial robots (LIRs). To identify potential
        strategies for energy optimization, standardized benchmarking procedures are
        required. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is currently
        no standardized method for benchmarking the EC of manipulators. In response
        to this need, we have developed a comprehensive benchmarking framework to
        evaluate the EC of various LIR designs, delving into the theoretical power
        consumption under both static and dynamic conditions. Our analysis has led
        to the proposal of seven proposed metrics—three static and four dynamic. The
        static metrics—controller consumption, joint electronics consumption, and
        mechanical brakes' consumption—evaluate the maintenance EC of the robot. Meanwhile,
        we suggest three dynamic metrics that gauge the system’s energy efficiency
        during motion, with or without payload. We extend this metrics selection by
        introducing the cost of transportation map for manipulators. For each of the
        metrics, we suggest a standardized measurement procedure based on state-of-the-art
        norms and literature. The metric set and experimental procedures are demonstrated
        using five manipulators (UR3e, UR5e, FR3, M0609, Gen3). Among the results,
        we can see interesting trends for future optimization of the electronic components
        and their architecture, eg, reducing the robot's EC by decentralizing computation

        decades, establishing itself as a cornerstone of contemporary industry. Augmented
        Reality, an emerging technology, enhances the interaction between humans and
        machines, including computers and robots. Today, numerous examples exist of
        the union of these two technologies to create real-augmented digital-twin
        models of collaborative robots. However, these models often lack data on motor
        currents and power consumption. In this study, we propose a real-augmented
        digital-twin model that accurately estimates energy consumption. This additional
        energy information equips the tool for various applications such as robot
        optimization, commissioning, and troubleshooting. We employ our real-augmented
        digital-twin model to test methods for reducing Cobots' energy consumption,
        using the tool to demonstrate and train Cobot practitioners on these techniques'
        applications. The model is also useful for anomaly detection (troubleshooting)
        when the robot's consumption statistically deviates from the ideal model.
        Moreover, the model can anticipate the robot's power consumption during the
        commissioning phase, prior to its installation. Through a series of experiments
        and a practical demonstration at a robot fair for practitioners, we illustrate
        the benefits and training capabilities of our approach.

      abstract: Location Fingerprinting (LF) is a promising location technique for
        many awareness applications in pervasive computing. However, as research on
        LF systems goes beyond basic methods there is an increasing need for better
        comparison of proposed LF systems. Developers of LF systems are also lacking
        good frameworks for understanding different options when building LF systems.
        This paper proposes a taxonomy to address both of these problems. The proposed
        taxonomy has been constructed from a literature study of 51 papers and articles
        about LF. For researchers the taxonomy can also be used as an aid when scoping
        out future research in the area of LF.

      abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant potential in accelerating
        the design of microwave components owing to its great ability to approximate
        the projection between geometric parameters and electromagnetic (EM) responses.
        A well-trained ML model can predict the EM responses of a microwave component
        with unseen geometric parameter settings accurately, or determine the parameter
        settings based on desired EM constraints in a matter of milliseconds. However,
        this ML-based design process often requires heavy simulation to collect a
        large amount of training data. To mitigate this issue, this article proposes
        an efficient Bayesian-inspired sampling-assisted ML method for the design
        of microwave components. In contrast to typical ML-based design methods which
        use uniform and arbitrary sampling to extensively represent the entire parameter
        space, necessitating intensive simulation for …

      abstract: This manuscript proposes a new design of phased array antenna for
        future fifth generation (5G) cellular communications. The proposed phased
        array antenna is designed on a low-cost N9000 PTFE substrate with overall
        size of 60×130×0.8 mm 3 . It consists of eight 28-GHz Vivaldi antenna elements
        used to form a linear phased array in the edge region (top-side) on a mobile
        phone PCB. The simulated results show that the antenna has the reflection
        coefficient (S11) less than -10 dB in the frequency range of 27.4 to 28.6
        GHz. The proposed phased array antenna has good gain, efficiency, and 3D beam
        steering characteristics in the entire operation band, which makes it suitable
        for millimeter-wave 5G communications. In addition, the performance of the
        antenna in the vicinity of user's hand has been investigated in this study.

        antennas have been compactly arranged along the edge region of the mobile
        phone printed circuit board (PCB) to form the antenna package. By switching
        the feeding to one of the subarrays, the desired direction of coverage can
        be achieved. The proposed design has >10-dB gain in the upper spherical space,
        good directivity, and efficiency, which is suitable for 5G mobile communications.
        In addition, the impact of the user's hand on the antenna performance has

      abstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid model transfer learning approach
        designed for end-to-end OFDM neural receivers that effectively manage multiple
        channels and nonlinear transmitters. The hybrid model transfer learning method

      abstract: 'Deep learning-assisted antenna design methods such as surrogate models
        have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their potential
        to greatly increase design efficiencies by replacing the time-consuming full-wave
        electromagnetic (EM) simulations. However, a large number of training data
        with sufficiently diverse and representative samples (antenna structure parameters,
        scattering properties, etc.) is mandatory for these methods to ensure good
        performance. Traditional antenna modeling methods relying on manual model
        construction and modification are time-consuming and cannot meet the requirement
        of efficient training data acquisition. In this study, we proposed a deep
        learning-assisted and image-based intelligent modeling approach for accelerating
        the data acquisition of antenna samples with different physical structures.
        Specifically, our method only needs an image of the antenna structure, usually
        available in scientific publications, as the input while the corresponding
        modeling codes (VBA language) are generated automatically. The proposed model
        mainly consists of two parts: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long
        Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The former is used for capturing features
        of antenna structure images and the latter is employed to generate the modeling
        codes. Through training, the proposed model can achieve fast and automatic
        data acquisition of antenna physical structures based on antenna images. Experiment
        results show that the proposed method achieves a significant speed enhancement

      abstract: The ethics of Machine Learning has become an unavoidable topic in
        the AI Community. The deployment of machine learning systems in multiple social
        contexts has resulted in a closer ethical scrutiny of the design, development,
        and application of these systems. The AI/ML community has come to terms with
        the imperative to think about the ethical implications of machine learning,
        not only as a product but also as a practice (Birhane, 2021; Shen et al. 2021).
        The critical question that is troubling many debates is what can constitute
        an ethically accountable machine learning system. In this paper we explore
        possibilities for ethical evaluation of machine learning methodologies. We
        scrutinize techniques, methods and technical practices in machine learning
        from a relational ethics perspective, taking into consideration how machine
        learning systems are part of the world and how they relate to different forms
        of agency. Taking a page from Phil Agre (1997) we use the notion of a critical
        technical practice as a means of analysis of machine learning approaches.
        Our radical proposal is that supervised learning appears to be the only machine
        learning method that is ethically defensible.

        complexity for some combinatorial problems.

        in episodic Regular Decision Processes (RDPs). RDPs are the subclass of Non-Markov
        Decision Processes where the dependency on the history of past events can
        be captured by a finite-state automaton. We consider a setting where the automaton
        that underlies the RDP is unknown, and a learner strives to learn a near-optimal
        policy using pre-collected data, in the form of non-Markov sequences of observations,
        without further exploration. We present RegORL, an algorithm that suitably
        combines automata learning techniques and state-of-the-art algorithms for

        sample complexity bound for RegORL to yield an -optimal policy, which makes

        this is the first work presenting a provably efficient algorithm for offline

      abstract: Recent success stories in reinforcement learning have demonstrated
        that leveraging structural properties of the underlying environment is key
        in devising viable methods capable of solving complex tasks. We study off-policy
        learning in discounted reinforcement learning, where some equivalence relation
        in the environment exists. We introduce a new model-free algorithm, called
        QL-ES (Q-learning with equivalence structure), which is a variant of (asynchronous)
        Q-learning tailored to exploit the equivalence structure in the MDP. We report
        a non-asymptotic PAC-type sample complexity bound for QL-ES, thereby establishing
        its sample efficiency. This bound also allows us to quantify the superiority
        of QL-ES over Q-learning analytically, which shows that the theoretical gain
        in some domains can be massive. We report extensive numerical experiments
        demonstrating that QL-ES converges significantly faster than (structure-oblivious)
        Q-learning empirically. They imply that the empirical performance gain obtained
        by exploiting the equivalence structure could be massive, even in simple domains.
        To the best of our knowledge, QL-ES is the first provably efficient model-free
        algorithm to exploit the equivalence structure in finite MDPs.

      abstract: Can we solve finite-horizon Markov decision processes (FHMDPs) while
        raising low memory requirements? Such models find application in many cases
        where a decision-making agent needs to act in a probabilistic environment,
        from resource management to medicine to service provisioning. However, computing
        optimal policies such an agent should follow by dynamic programming value
        iteration raises either prohibitive space complexity, or, in reverse, non-scalable
        time complexity requirements. This scalability question has been largely neglected.
        In this paper, we propose SIFTER (Space Efficient Finite Horizon MDPs), a
        suite of algorithms that achieve a golden middle between space and time requirements.
        Our former algorithm raises space complexity growing with the square root
        of the horizon's length without a time-complexity overhead, while the latter's
        space requirements depend only logarithmically in …

        problem from a novel point of view considering the need for privacy and anonymity.
        We have proposed a method for incorporating security into the scalable average
        consensus mechanisms proposed in the literature. Random Offsets Method (ROM)
        is lightweight, transparent and flexible since it is not based on cryptography,
        does not require any change in the fusion system and can be used optionally
        by some nodes who care about their privacy. In this method, which is based
        on noisification of nodes' information, we achieve robustness against n -
        1 colluding adversaries in a network of in nodes, which is maximum level of
        robustness against collusions. Convergence and collusion robustness of ROM
        are analyzed mathematically and through simulation.

      abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for decision processes with non-Markovian
        reward, in which high-level knowledge in the form of reward machines is available
        to the learner. Specifically, we investigate the efficiency of RL under the
        average-reward criterion, in the regret minimization setting. We propose two
        model-based RL algorithms that each exploits the structure of the reward machines,
        and show that our algorithms achieve regret bounds that improve over those
        of baselines by a multiplicative factor proportional to the number of states
        in the underlying reward machine. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
        algorithms and associated regret bounds are the first to tailor the analysis
        specifically to reward machines, either in the episodic or average-reward
        settings. We also present a regret lower bound for the studied setting, which
        indicates that the proposed algorithms achieve a near-optimal regret. Finally,
        we report numerical experiments that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
        algorithms over existing baselines in practice.

      abstract: The problem of reinforcement learning in an unknown and discrete Markov
        Decision Process (MDP) under the average-reward criterion is considered, when
        the learner interacts with the system in a single stream of observations,
        starting from an initial state without any reset. We revisit the minimax lower
        bound for that problem by making appear the local variance of the bias function
        in place of the diameter of the MDP. Furthermore, we provide a novel analysis
        of the\texttt {\textsc {KL-Ucrl}} algorithm establishing a high-probability
        regret bound scaling as  for this algorithm for ergodic MDPs, where  denotes
        the number of states and where  is the variance of the bias function with
        respect to the next-state distribution following action  in state . The resulting
        bound improves upon the best previously known regret bound $\widetilde {\Ocal}(DS\sqrt
        {AT}) $ for that algorithm, where  and  respectively denote the maximum number
        of actions (per state) and the diameter of MDP. We finally compare the leading
        terms of the two bounds in some benchmark MDPs indicating that the derived
        bound can provide an order of magnitude improvement in some cases. Our analysis
        leverages novel variations of the transportation lemma combined with Kullback-Leibler
        concentration inequalities, that we believe to be of independent interest.

      abstract: Graph representation learning has become a prominent tool for the
        characterization and understanding of the structure of networks in general
        and social networks in particular. Typically, these representation learning
        approaches embed the networks into a low-dimensional space in which the role
        of each individual can be characterized in terms of their latent position.
        A major current concern in social networks is the emergence of polarization
        and filter bubbles promoting a mindset of "us-versus-them" that may be defined
        by extreme positions believed to ultimately lead to political violence and
        the erosion of democracy. Such polarized networks are typically characterized
        in terms of signed links reflecting likes and dislikes. We propose the latent
        Signed relational Latent dIstance Model (SLIM) utilizing for the first time
        the Skellam distribution as a likelihood function for signed networks and
        extend the modeling to the characterization of distinct extreme positions
        by constraining the embedding space to polytopes. On four real social signed
        networks of polarization, we demonstrate that the model extracts low-dimensional
        characterizations that well predict friendships and animosity while providing
        interpretable visualizations defined by extreme positions when endowing the
        model with an embedding space restricted to polytopes.

        of clustering – without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness
        of svd – without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to

        by the FurthestFirst approach widely used for k-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys,
        1985 [14]). We generalize the aa procedure to kernel-aa in order to extract
        the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive
        a relaxation of aa when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations
        of the observed …

      abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has become a prominent tool for
        furthering the understanding of complex networks providing tools for network
        embedding, link prediction, and node classification. In this paper, we propose
        the Hybrid Membership-Latent Distance Model (HM-LDM) by exploring how a Latent
        Distance Model (LDM) can be constrained to a latent simplex. By controlling
        the edge lengths of the corners of the simplex, the volume of the latent space
        can be systematically controlled. Thereby communities are revealed as the
        space becomes more constrained, with hard memberships being recovered as the
        simplex volume goes to zero. We further explore a recent likelihood formulation
        for signed networks utilizing the Skellam distribution to account for signed
        weighted networks and extend the HM-LDM to the signed Hybrid Membership-Latent
        Distance Model (sHM-LDM). Importantly, the induced likelihood function explicitly
        attracts nodes with positive links and deters nodes from having negative interactions.
        We demonstrate the utility of HM-LDM and sHM-LDM on several real networks.
        We find that the procedures successfully identify prominent distinct structures,
        as well as how nodes relate to the extracted aspects providing favorable performances
        in terms of link prediction when compared to prominent baselines. Furthermore,
        the learned soft memberships enable easily interpretable network visualizations
        highlighting distinct patterns.

      abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become central for characterizing
        structures of complex networks and performing tasks such as link prediction,
        node classification, network reconstruction, and community detection. Whereas

        are widely used to improve our understanding of brain mechanisms and to identify
        biomarkers for the most diverse neurological pathologies (Tulay et al., 2019).
        However, electro-magnetoencephalography (E-MEG) and neuroimaging techniques,
        such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are complementary [ie,
        EEG/MEG techniques have an excellent temporal resolution at the expense of
        their spatial resolution and vice versa for fMRI or other neuroimaging techniques
        such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission
        tomography (PET) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)]. Furthermore,
        the complementarity of these techniques has led to the development of multimodal
        integration (Tulay et al., 2019).In recent decades, technological advances
        have allowed researchers to integrate different electrophysiological and neuroimaging
        techniques more efficiently to provide optimal spatial and temporal resolution.
        With its excellent spatial resolution and portability, EEG is often combined

      abstract: Neural implicit surfaces have emerged as an effective, learnable representation
        for shapes of arbitrary topology. However, representing open surfaces remains
        a challenge. Different methods, such as unsigned distance fields (UDF), have

        The generalized winding number (GWN), which is often used to distinguish interior
        points from exterior points of 3D shapes, is arguably the most promising approach.
        The GWN changes smoothly in regions where there is a hole in the surface,
        but it is discontinuous at points on the surface. Effectively, this means
        that it can be used in lieu of an implicit surface representation while providing
        information about holes, but, unfortunately, it does not provide information
        about the distance to the surface necessary for e.g. ray tracing, and special

      abstract: We present a deep learning model for image segmentation that uses
        weakly supervised inputs consisting of scribbles. A user can draw scribbles
        on an image with a brush tool corresponding to the labels they want segmented.
        The network can segment images in real time while scribbles are being drawn,
        giving instant feedback to the user. It is easy to correct mistakes made by
        the network, as more scribbles can be added. During training we use a similar
        psuedo-interactive and iterative setup to make sure that the network is optimized
        towards the human-in-the-loop inference setting. On the contrary, standard
        scribble segmentation methods do not consider the training of the algorithm
        as an interactive setting and thus are not suited for interactive inference.
        Our model is class-agnostic and we are able to generalize across many different
        data modalities. We compare our model with other weakly supervised methods
        such as bounding box and extrema point methods, and we show our model achieves
        a better mean DICE score.

      abstract: The most prevalent routine for camera calibration is based on the
        detection of well-defined feature points on a purpose-made calibration artifact.
        These could be checkerboard saddle points, circles, rings or triangles, often
        printed on a planar structure. The feature points are first detected and then
        used in a nonlinear optimization to estimate the internal camera parameters.
        We propose a new method for camera calibration using the principle of inverse
        rendering. Instead of relying solely on detected feature points, we use an
        estimate of the internal parameters and the pose of the calibration object
        to implicitly render a non-photorealistic equivalent of the optical features.
        This enables us to compute pixel-wise differences in the image domain without
        interpolation artifacts. We can then improve our estimate of the internal
        parameters by minimizing pixel-wise least-squares differences. In this way,
        our model optimizes a …

      abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation has reached an impressive performance.
        State-of-the-art mod-els predict joint locations that can be accurately reprojected
        back into the image, resulting in vi-sually convincing detections. However,
        our aim is to use the predicted poses in a domain with high-frequency movements,
        that is, for video of ath-letes performing golf swings. Our investigation
        is based on accurate marker-based motion capture data. Also, for our data,
        the predicted 3D joint locations look convincing when we reproject them into
        the image. However, by quantitatively com-paring the results with the motion
        capture data, we see significant model errors that are too erroneous to be
        used for any kinematic analysis of the move-ments. Thus we conclude that the
        current models cannot be used out of the box for advanced golf analytics.

      abstract: We present a deep metric variational autoencoder for multi-modal data
        generation. The variational autoencoder employs triplet loss in the latent
        space, which allows for conditional data generation by sampling in the latent
        space within each class cluster. The approach is evaluated on a multi-modal
        dataset consisting of otoscopy images of the tympanic membrane with corresponding
        wideband tympanometry measurements. The modalities in this dataset are correlated,
        as they represent different aspects of the state of the middle ear, but they
        do not present a direct pixel-to-pixel correlation. The approach shows promising
        results for the conditional generation of pairs of images and tympanograms,
        and will allow for efficient data augmentation of data from multi-modal sources.

      abstract: When 3D scanning objects, the objective is usually to obtain a continuous
        surface. However, most surface scanning methods, such as structured light
        scanning, yield a point cloud. Obtaining a continuous surface from a point
        cloud requires a subsequent surface reconstruction step, which is directly
        affected by any error from the computation of the point cloud. In this work,
        we propose a one-step approach in which we compute the surface directly from
        structured light images. Our method minimizes the least-squares error between
        photographs and renderings of a triangle mesh, where the vertex positions
        of the mesh are the parameters of the minimization problem. To ensure fast
        iterations during optimization, we use differentiable rendering, which computes
        images and gradients in a single pass. We present simulation experiments demonstrating
        that our method for computing a triangle mesh has several advantages over
        approaches that rely on an intermediate point cloud. Our method can produce
        accurate reconstructions when initializing the optimization from a sphere.
        We also show that our method is good at reconstructing sharp edges and that
        it is robust with respect to image noise. In addition, our method can improve
        the output from other reconstruction algorithms if we use these for initialization.

      abstract: Curvilinear structure segmentation is important in medical imaging,

        the small and low-contrast curvilinear structures. Prior topological information

        cost, and sometimes requiring prior knowledge of the expected topology.We

      abstract: Intermittent‐flow respirometry is an experimental protocol for measuring
        oxygen consumption in aquatic organisms that utilizes the best features of
        closed (stop‐flow) and flow‐through respirometry while eliminating (or at
        least reducing) some of their inherent problems. By interspersing short periods
        of closed‐chamber oxygen consumption measurements with regular flush periods,
        accurate oxygen uptake rate measurements can be made without the accumulation
        of waste products, particularly carbon dioxide, which may confound results.
        Automating the procedure with easily available hardware and software further
        reduces error by allowing many measurements to be made over long periods thereby
        minimizing animal stress due to acclimation issues. This paper describes some
        of the fundamental principles that need to be considered when designing and

      abstract: Medical images used in clinical practice are heterogeneous and not
        the same quality as scans studied in academic research. Preprocessing breaks
        down in extreme cases when anatomy, artifacts, or imaging parameters are unusual
        or protocols are different. Methods robust to these variations are most needed.
        A novel deep learning method is proposed for fast and accurate segmentation
        of the human brain into 132 regions. The proposed model uses an efficient
        U-Net-like network and benefits from the intersection points of different
        views and hierarchical relations for the fusion of the orthogonal 2D planes
        and brain labels during the end-to-end training. Weakly supervised learning
        is deployed to take the advantage of partially labeled data for the whole
        brain segmentation and estimation of the intracranial volume (ICV). Moreover,
        data augmentation is used to expand the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data
        by generating realistic brain scans with high variability for robust training
        of the model while preserving data privacy. The proposed method can be applied
        to brain MRI data including skull or any other artifacts without preprocessing
        the images or a drop in performance. Several experiments using different atlases
        are conducted to evaluate the segmentation performance of the trained model
        compared to the state-of-the-art, and the results show higher segmentation
        accuracy and robustness of the proposed model compared to the existing methods
        across different intra- and inter-domain datasets.

      abstract: Gamma oscillations (≈25–100 Hz) are believed to play an essential
        role in cognition, and aberrant gamma oscillations occur in brain aging and
        neurodegeneration. This study examined age-related changes in visually evoked
        gamma oscillations at two different time points 5 years apart and tested the
        hypothesis that the power of gamma oscillations correlated to cognitive skills.The
        cohort consists of elderly males belonging to the Metropolit 1953 Danish Male
        Birth Cohort (first visit, N=124; second visit, N=88) over a 5-year period
        from 63 to 68 years of age. Cognitive functions were assessed using a neuropsychological
        test battery measuring global cognition, intelligence, memory, and processing

      abstract: Deep learning-based models in medical imaging often struggle to generalize
        effectively to new scans due to data heterogeneity arising from differences
        in hardware, acquisition parameters, population, and artifacts. This limitation
        presents a significant challenge in adopting machine learning models for clinical
        practice. We propose an unsupervised method for robust domain adaptation in
        brain MRI segmentation by leveraging MRI-specific augmentation techniques.
        To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments
        across diverse datasets, modalities, and segmentation tasks, comparing against
        the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our proposed approach
        achieves high accuracy, exhibits broad applicability, and showcases remarkable
        robustness against domain shift in various tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art
        performance in the majority of cases.

        to predict risks at different stages of management and thereby provide insights

        a cohort of approx. 2.6 million citizens in Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests

        at least one positive test and were subjected to further analysis. SARS-CoV-2

      abstract: Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging
        machine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies
        among measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories,
        do not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects’
        trajectories. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized
        to address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain
        incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires
        a pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we
        propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture,
        long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor
        and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the progression

      abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with an increased
        risk of stroke, cognitive decline, and dementia. A robust, yet accurate detection
        of WMH can help with the prevention of more lesions from forming. The task
        is still challenging as the lesions are often small and irregular. Hence,
        we propose a robust deep learning-based method for the automatic segmentation
        of WMH only using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans and MRI-specific
        data augmentation and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The methods
        are tested on public and private data, and we show that our model is more
        robust to domain shift and achieves higher segmentation accuracy than the
        alternatives.

      abstract: Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs), typically captured as hypointensities
        from susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), are particularly important for
        the study of dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and normal aging. Recent studies
        on COVID-19 have shown an increase in CMBs of coronavirus cases. Automatic
        detection of CMBs is challenging due to the small size and amount of CMBs
        making the classes highly imbalanced, lack of publicly available annotated
        data, and similarity with CMB mimics such as calcifications, irons, and veins.
        Hence, the existing deep learning methods are mostly trained on very limited
        research data and fail to generalize to unseen data with high variability
        and cannot be used in clinical setups. To this end, we propose an efficient
        3D deep learning framework that is actively trained on multi-domain data.
        Two public datasets assigned for normal aging, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease
        analysis as well as an in-house dataset for COVID-19 assessment are used to
        train and evaluate the models. The obtained results show that the proposed
        method is robust to low-resolution images and achieves 78% recall and 80%
        precision on the entire test set with an average false positive of 1.6 per
        scan.

      abstract: Deep learning based approaches have been dominating the face recognition
        field due to the significant performance improvement they have provided on
        the challenging wild datasets. These approaches have been extensively tested
        on such unconstrained datasets, on the Labeled Faces in the Wild and YouTube
        Faces, to name a few. However, their capability to handle individual appearance
        variations caused by factors such as head pose, illumination, occlusion, and
        misalignment has not been thoroughly assessed till now. In this paper, we
        present a comprehensive study to evaluate the performance of deep learning
        based face representation under several conditions including the varying head
        pose angles, upper and lower face occlusion, changing illumination of different
        strengths, and misalignment due to erroneous facial feature localization.
        Two successful and publicly available deep learning models, namely VGG-Face
        and Lightened CNN have been utilized to extract face representations. The
        obtained results show that although deep learning provides a powerful representation
        for face recognition, it can still benefit from preprocessing, for example,
        for pose and illumination normalization in order to achieve better performance
        under various conditions. Particularly, if these variations are not included
        in the dataset used to train the deep learning model, the role of preprocessing
        becomes more crucial. Experimental results also show that deep learning based
        representation is robust to misalignment and can tolerate facial feature localization
        errors up to 10% of the interocular distance.

      abstract: 'This essay is an invitation for feminist readers to actively engage
        in “reweaving the tapestry” of women’s intellectual history.[1] I start by
        tracing a sketch of how the expectation that women should remain silent arose
        in Western cultures: my examples range from antiquity to the early modern
        period, and come from diverse linguistic groups, illustrating that the trope
        of silence affects women all over the Western world. I subsequently proceed
        to show that this is not simply a literary trope affecting works of fiction:
        it can have drastic consequences for our understanding of women’s roles in
        history. Anybody—including scholars—can be influenced by a discursive horizon
        within which women are expected to have no voice. Next, I discuss a few concrete
        strategies that feminist scholars have used in approaching historical evidence
        about women’s lives, highlighting some of the benefits afforded by such strategies.
        In conclusion, I emphasise that writing and reading are entangled practices,
        and invite readers to take full responsibility for their roles in the process
        of making meaning from texts by women from the past.'

        Privacy and the Private in Early Modern Dutch Contexts, Natália da Silva Perez
        argues that privacy can be a productive analytical lens to examine the social
        history of the Dutch Republic. She starts by providing an overview of theoretical
        definitions of privacy and of the ‘private versus public’dichotomy, highlighting
        their implications for the study of society. Next, she discusses the modern
        view of privacy as a legally protected right, explaining that we must adjust
        expectations when applying the concept to historical examination: in the early
        modern period, privacy was not yet fully incorporated within a legal framework,
        and yet, it was a widespread need across different echelons of society. She
        provides a historical overview of this widespread need for privacy through
        instances where people attempted to regulate access to their material and
        immaterial resources. Finally, she describes how the four articles in this
        special issue contribute to our understanding of the role of privacy in early
        modern Dutch life.'

        research partnership on the study of material culture. With its highly formal
        language and wealth of detailed historical evidence, A Day at Home was clearly
        written for an audience of specialists, and it is manifestly grounded at the
        intersection of Hamling’s and Richardson’s specializations: literary and cultural
        history, art history, and religious history. This elegantly edited publication
        contains pictures, lists of items appearing in probate inventories, schematic
        blueprints, and diagrams that accompany the authors’ nuanced analysis of written
        and material historical evidence about the home. The main goal of A Day at
        Home is to show the central importance of the home as a place where social
        performances, religious beliefs, and work activities all came together to
        shape status and identity for the middling level of society. The ‘middling
        sort,’the authors explain, were financially affluent, but their social status
        was not elite; they were ‘neither very rich nor very poor.’1 Hence their preoccupation
        with outward demonstrations of moral behaviour, religious observance, and
        loyalty towards those ranking higher then themselves in society, something
        evidenced by the vast material culture analysed in the book. The authors warn
        the reader from the start that A Day at Home is not a book about family or
        private life, but instead about ‘the way behaviours were located within the

      abstract: Area-wide information on Vegetation Height (VH) has been recognized
        of great value for many applications such as large-scale analysis and evaluation
        of various forest functions (carbon stock, timber production, biodiversity,
        or protection against natural hazards). This is why the Swiss National Forest
        Inventory (NFI) generates and provides countrywide vegetation height maps
        using aerial imagebased point clouds (Ginzler and Hobi 2015). The high spatial
        map resolution of 0.5 m and their regular update (every six years) enable
        fine-scale structural analyses in the forest. However, the updating period
        of six years limits certain applications in which the time factor plays an
        important role such as disturbance and change analyses. Lang et al.(2019)
        showed that it is possible to map vegetation height annually with Sentinel-2
        (S2) data. They modelled the mean VH on a spatial resolution of 10 m with

        resources are systematically assessed by national inventories. The contribution

        have a systematic bias of 7.6% (overestimation; R = 0.98) compared to national
        inventories of 30 countries, and our dataset is sufficiently highly resolved
        spatially to support the inclusion of tree biomass outside forests, which
        we quantify to 0.8 petagrams. Although this represents only 2% of the total
        tree biomass, large variations between countries are found (10% for UK) and
        trees in urban areas contribute substantially to national carbon stocks (8%

      abstract: We introduce an approach for updating older tree inventories with
        geographic coordinates using street-level panorama images and a global optimization
        framework for tree instance matching. Geolocations of trees in inventories
        until the early 2000s where recorded using street addresses whereas newer
        inventories use GPS. Our method retrofits older inventories with geographic
        coordinates to allow connecting them with newer inventories to facilitate
        long-term studies on tree mortality etc. What makes this problem challenging
        is the different number of trees per street address, the heterogeneous appearance

      abstract: 'The worldwide variation in vegetation height is fundamental to the
        global carbon cycle and central to the functioning of ecosystems and their
        biodiversity. Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information
        is required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change, and
        prevent biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first global, wall-to-wall
        canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. No single
        data source meets these requirements: dedicated space missions like GEDI deliver
        sparse height data, with unprecedented coverage, whereas optical satellite
        images like Sentinel-2 offer dense observations globally, but cannot directly
        measure vertical structures. By fusing GEDI with Sentinel-2, we have developed
        a probabilistic deep learning model to retrieve canopy height from Sentinel-2
        images anywhere on Earth, and to quantify the uncertainty in these estimates.
        The presented approach reduces the saturation effect commonly encountered
        when estimating canopy height from satellite images, allowing to resolve tall
        canopies with likely high carbon stocks. According to our map, only 5% of
        the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Such data play an
        important role for conservation, e.g., we find that only 34% of these tall
        canopies are located within protected areas. Our model enables consistent,
        uncertainty-informed worldwide mapping and supports an ongoing monitoring
        to detect change and inform decision making. The approach can serve ongoing
        efforts in forest conservation, and has the potential to foster advances in
        climate, carbon, and biodiversity modelling.'

      abstract: Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, the world’s largest producers of cocoa, account
        for two thirds of the global cocoa production. In both countries, cocoa is
        the primary perennial crop, providing income to almost two million farmers.
        Yet precise maps of the area planted with cocoa are missing, hindering accurate
        quantification of expansion in protected areas, production and yields and
        limiting information available for improved sustainability governance. Here
        we combine cocoa plantation data with publicly available satellite imagery
        in a deep learning framework and create high-resolution maps of cocoa plantations
        for both countries, validated in situ. Our results suggest that cocoa cultivation
        is an underlying driver of over 37% of forest loss in protected areas in Côte
        d’Ivoire and over 13% in Ghana, and that official reports substantially underestimate
        the planted area (up to 40% in Ghana). These maps serve as a crucial …

        mission whose goal is to advance our understanding of the role of forests
        in the global carbon cycle. While GEDI is the first space-based LIDAR explicitly

        the accurate interpretation of this vast amount of waveform data across the

      abstract: Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images collected over periods of several
        months were used to estimate vegetation height for Gabon and Switzerland.
        A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to extract suitable
        spectral and textural features from reflectance images and to regress per-pixel
        vegetation height. In Gabon, reference heights for training and validation
        were derived from airborne LiDAR measurements. In Switzerland, reference heights
        were taken from an existing canopy height model derived via photogrammetric

        of 1.7 m in Switzerland and 4.3 m in Gabon (a root mean square error (RMSE)
        of 3.4 m and 5.6 m, respectively), and correctly estimate vegetation heights

      abstract: Researchers who analyse smartphone usage logs often make the assumption
        that users who lock and unlock their phone for brief periods of time (e.g.,
        less than a minute) are continuing the same "session" of interaction. However,
        this assumption is not empirically validated, and in fact different studies
        apply different arbitrary thresholds in their analysis. To validate this assumption,
        we conducted a field study where we collected user-labelled activity data
        through ESM and sensor logging. Our results indicate that for the majority
        of instances where users return to their smartphone, i.e., unlock their device,
        they in fact begin a new session as opposed to continuing a previous one.

        periods is not reliable, but optimisation is possible. We therefore propose
        various metrics related to usage sessions and evaluate various machine learning

      abstract: Living with Parkinson’s Disease introduces a range of significant
        challenges into one’s daily life. While medical interventions exist to overcome
        some of these challenges, patient self-care techniques often form an essential
        complement to the treatments recommended by medical doctors. Knowledge on
        these self-care techniques often originates from those living with Parkinson’s
        themselves or their close caregivers, as they have the knowledge and experience
        required to assess self-care techniques. This so-called ‘patient knowledge’
        is usually exchanged in peer meetings or discussion forums. Although vital

      abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant and enduring shifts
        in various aspects of life, including increased flexibility in work arrangements.
        In a longitudinal study, spanning 24 months with six measurement points from
        April 2020 to April 2022, we explore changes in well-being, productivity,
        social contacts, and needs of software engineers during this time. Our findings
        indicate systematic changes in various variables. For example, well-being
        and quality of social contacts increased while emotional loneliness decreased
        as lockdown measures were relaxed. Conversely, people’s boredom and productivity,
        remained stable. Furthermore, a preliminary investigation into the future
        of work at the end of the pandemic revealed a consensus among developers for
        a preference of hybrid work arrangements. We also discovered that prior job
        changes and low job satisfaction were consistently linked to intentions to
        change jobs if current work conditions do not meet developers’ needs. This
        highlights the need for software organizations to adapt to various work arrangements
        to remain competitive employers. Building upon our findings and the existing
        literature, we introduce the Integrated Job Demands-Resources and Self-Determination
        (IJARS) Model as a comprehensive framework to explain the well-being and productivity
        of software engineers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has become a prominent tool for
        furthering the understanding of complex networks providing tools for network
        embedding, link prediction, and node classification. In this paper, we propose
        the Hybrid Membership-Latent Distance Model (HM-LDM) by exploring how a Latent
        Distance Model (LDM) can be constrained to a latent simplex. By controlling
        the edge lengths of the corners of the simplex, the volume of the latent space
        can be systematically controlled. Thereby communities are revealed as the
        space becomes more constrained, with hard memberships being recovered as the
        simplex volume goes to zero. We further explore a recent likelihood formulation
        for signed networks utilizing the Skellam distribution to account for signed
        weighted networks and extend the HM-LDM to the signed Hybrid Membership-Latent
        Distance Model (sHM-LDM). Importantly, the induced likelihood function explicitly
        attracts nodes with positive links and deters nodes from having negative interactions.
        We demonstrate the utility of HM-LDM and sHM-LDM on several real networks.
        We find that the procedures successfully identify prominent distinct structures,
        as well as how nodes relate to the extracted aspects providing favorable performances
        in terms of link prediction when compared to prominent baselines. Furthermore,
        the learned soft memberships enable easily interpretable network visualizations
        highlighting distinct patterns.

        Weighted Networks

      abstract: Networks have become indispensable and ubiquitous structures in many
        fields to model the interactions among different entities, such as friendship
        in social networks or protein interactions in biological graphs. A major challenge
        is to understand the structure and dynamics of these systems. Although networks
        evolve through time, most existing graph representation learning methods target
        only static networks. Whereas approaches have been developed for the modeling
        of dynamic networks, there is a lack of efficient continuous time dynamic
        graph representation learning methods that can provide accurate network characterization
        and visualization in low dimensions while explicitly accounting for prominent
        network characteristics such as homophily and transitivity. In this paper,
        we propose the Piecewise-Velocity Model (PiVeM) for the representation of
        continuous-time dynamic networks. It learns dynamic embeddings in which the
        temporal evolution of nodes is approximated by piecewise linear interpolations
        based on a latent distance model with piecewise constant node-specific velocities.
        The model allows for analytically tractable expressions of the associated
        Poisson process likelihood with scalable inference invariant to the number
        of events. We further impose a scalable Kronecker structured Gaussian Process
        prior to the dynamics accounting for community structure, temporal smoothness,
        and disentangled (uncorrelated) latent embedding dimensions optimally learned
        to characterize the network dynamics. We show that PiVeM can successfully
        represent network structure and dynamics in ultra-low two-dimensional spaces.
        It outperforms …

      abstract: Graph representation learning has become a prominent tool for the
        characterization and understanding of the structure of networks in general
        and social networks in particular. Typically, these representation learning
        approaches embed the networks into a low-dimensional space in which the role
        of each individual can be characterized in terms of their latent position.
        A major current concern in social networks is the emergence of polarization
        and filter bubbles promoting a mindset of "us-versus-them" that may be defined
        by extreme positions believed to ultimately lead to political violence and
        the erosion of democracy. Such polarized networks are typically characterized
        in terms of signed links reflecting likes and dislikes. We propose the latent
        Signed relational Latent dIstance Model (SLIM) utilizing for the first time
        the Skellam distribution as a likelihood function for signed networks and
        extend the modeling to the characterization of distinct extreme positions
        by constraining the embedding space to polytopes. On four real social signed
        networks of polarization, we demonstrate that the model extracts low-dimensional
        characterizations that well predict friendships and animosity while providing
        interpretable visualizations defined by extreme positions when endowing the
        model with an embedding space restricted to polytopes.

      abstract: We create WebQAmGaze, a multilingual low-cost eye-tracking-while-reading
        dataset, designed to support the development of fair and transparent NLP models.
        WebQAmGaze includes webcam eye-tracking data from 332 participants naturally
        reading English, Spanish, and German texts. Each participant performs two
        reading tasks composed of five texts, a normal reading and an information-seeking
        task. After preprocessing the data, we find that fixations on relevant spans
        seem to indicate correctness when answering the comprehension questions. Additionally,
        we perform a comparative analysis of the data collected to high-quality eye-tracking
        data. The results show a moderate correlation between the features obtained
        with the webcam-ET compared to those of a commercial ET device. We believe
        this data can advance webcam-based reading studies and open a way to cheaper
        and more accessible data collection. WebQAmGaze is useful to learn about the
        cognitive processes behind question answering (QA) and to apply these insights
        to computational models of language understanding.

        Research suggests that the opaque orthography of the Danish language affects

        this is the first attempt to classify dyslexia from eye movements during reading

        model yields 0.85 F1 score.

      abstract: An interesting method of evaluating word representations is by how
        much they reflect the semantic representations in the human brain. However,
        most, if not all, previous works only focus on small datasets and a single
        modality. In this paper, we present the first multi-modal framework for evaluating
        English word representations based on cognitive lexical semantics. Six types
        of word embeddings are evaluated by fitting them to 15 datasets of eye-tracking,
        EEG and fMRI signals recorded during language processing. To achieve a global
        score over all evaluation hypotheses, we apply statistical significance testing
        accounting for the multiple comparisons problem. This framework is easily
        extensible and available to include other intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation
        methods. We find strong correlations in the results between cognitive datasets,
        across recording modalities and to their performance on extrinsic NLP tasks.

      abstract: 'Zero-shot learning models achieve remarkable results on image classification
        for samples from classes that were not seen during training. However, such
        models must be trained from scratch with specialised methods: therefore, access
        to a training dataset is required when the need for zero-shot classification
        arises. In this paper, we aim to equip pre-trained models with zero-shot classification
        capabilities without the use of image data. We achieve this with our proposed
        Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS) that injects classifiers
        for new, unseen classes into pre-trained classification models in a post-hoc
        fashion without relying on image data. Instead, the existing classifier weights
        and simple class-wise descriptors, such as class names or attributes, are
        used. ICIS has two encoder-decoder networks that learn to reconstruct classifier
        weights from descriptors (and vice versa), exploiting (cross-)reconstruction
        and cosine losses to regularise the decoding process. Notably, ICIS can be
        cheaply trained and applied directly on top of pre-trained classification
        models. Experiments on benchmark ZSL datasets show that ICIS produces unseen

        However deep models with several layers of dependent stochastic variables
        are difficult to train which limits the improvements obtained using these

        Autoencoder, that recursively corrects the generative distribution by a data
        dependent approximate likelihood in a process resembling the recently proposed
        Ladder Network. We show that this model provides state of the art predictive

        bottom-up inference in layered Variational Autoencoders and other generative

        we observe that batch-normalization and deterministic warm-up (gradually turning
        on the KL-term) are crucial for training variational models with many stochastic
        layers.

      abstract: Neural Persistence is a prominent measure for quantifying neural network
        complexity, proposed in the emerging field of topological data analysis in
        deep learning. In this work, however, we find both theoretically and empirically
        that the variance of network weights and spatial concentration of large weights
        are the main factors that impact neural persistence. Whilst this captures
        useful information for linear classifiers, we find that no relevant spatial
        structure is present in later layers of deep neural networks, making neural
        persistence roughly equivalent to the variance of weights. Additionally, the
        proposed averaging procedure across layers for deep neural networks does not
        consider interaction between layers. Based on our analysis, we propose an
        extension of the filtration underlying neural persistence to the whole neural
        network instead of single layers, which is equivalent to calculating neural
        persistence on one particular matrix. This yields our deep graph persistence
        measure, which implicitly incorporates persistent paths through the network
        and alleviates variance-related issues through standardisation. Code is available

      abstract: The prediction of eukaryotic protein subcellular localization is a
        well-studied topic in bioinformatics due to its relevance in proteomics research.
        Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task,
        but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge
        databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for
        predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods
        for predicting protein properties from sequence information only.Here, we
        present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein
        subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core,
        the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire
        protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important
        for the subcellular …

      abstract: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are expected to play a critical role
        in precision medicine. Currently, PRS predictors are generally based on linear
        models using summary statistics, and more recently individual-level data.
        However, these predictors mainly capture additive relationships and are limited
        in data modalities they can use. We developed a deep learning framework (EIR)
        for PRS prediction which includes a model, genome-local-net (GLN), specifically
        designed for large-scale genomics data. The framework supports multi-task
        learning, automatic integration of other clinical and biochemical data, and
        model explainability. When applied to individual-level data from the UK Biobank,
        the GLN model demonstrated a competitive performance compared to established
        neural network architectures, particularly for certain traits, showcasing
        its potential in modeling complex genetic relationships. Furthermore, the

      abstract: Retrieval-augmented models have proven to be effective in natural
        language processing tasks, yet there remains a lack of research on their optimization
        using variational inference. We introduce the Variational Open-Domain (VOD)
        framework for end-to-end training and evaluation of retrieval-augmented models,
        focusing on open-domain question answering and language modelling. The VOD
        objective, a self-normalized estimate of the Rényi variational bound, approximates
        the task marginal likelihood and is evaluated under samples drawn from an
        auxiliary sampling distribution (cached retriever and/or approximate posterior).
        It remains tractable, even for retriever distributions defined on large corpora.
        We demonstrate VOD’s versatility by training reader-retriever BERT-sized models
        on multiple-choice medical exam questions. On the MedMCQA dataset, we outperform
        the domain-tuned Med-PaLM by+ 5.3% despite using 2.500 fewer parameters. Our
        retrieval-augmented BioLinkBERT model scored 62.9% on the MedMCQA and 55.0%
        on the MedQA-USMLE. Last, we show the effectiveness of our learned retriever
        component in the context of medical semantic search.

      abstract: Emojis are an integral part of Internet communication nowadays. Even
        though, they are supposed to make the text clearer and less dubious, some
        emojis are ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. One of the
        factors that determine the perception of emojis is the user’s personality.
        In this work, I conducted an experimental study and investigated how personality
        traits, measured with a Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire, affect reaction
        time when interpreting emoji. For a set of emoji, for which there are several
        possible interpretations, participants had to determine whether the emoji
        fits the presented context or not. Using regression analysis, I found that
        conscientiousness and neuroticism significantly predict the reaction time
        the person needs to decide about the emoji. More conscientious people take
        longer to resolve ambiguity, while more neurotic people make decisions about
        ambiguous emoji faster. The knowledge of the relationship between personality
        and emoji interpretation can lead to effective use of knowledge of people’s
        characters in personalizing interactive computer systems.

      abstract: Decoders built on Gaussian processes (GPs) are enticing due to the
        marginalisation over the non-linear function space. Such models (also known
        as GP-LVMs) are often expensive and notoriously difficult to train in practice,
        but can be scaled using variational inference and inducing points. In this
        paper, we revisit active set approximations. We develop a new stochastic estimate
        of the log-marginal likelihood based on recently discovered links to cross-validation,
        and we propose a computationally efficient approximation thereof. We demonstrate
        that the resulting stochastic active sets (SAS) approximation significantly
        improves the robustness of GP decoder training, while reducing computational
        cost. The SAS-GP obtains more structure in the latent space, scales to many
        datapoints, and learns better representations than variational autoencoders,
        which is rarely the case for GP decoders.

      abstract: We present a method to approximate Gaussian process regression models
        to large datasets by considering only a subset of the data. Our approach is
        novel in that the size of the subset is selected on the fly during exact inference
        with little computational overhead. From an empirical observation that the
        log-marginal likelihood often exhibits a linear trend once a sufficient subset
        of a dataset has been observed, we conclude that many large datasets contain
        redundant information that only slightly affects the posterior. Based on this,
        we provide probabilistic bounds on the full model evidence that can identify
        such subsets. Remarkably, these bounds are largely composed of terms that
        appear in intermediate steps of the standard Cholesky decomposition, allowing
        us to modify the algorithm to adaptively stop the decomposition once enough
        data have been observed.

      abstract: Suicide is a major global public health issue that is becoming increasingly
        common despite preventive efforts. Though current methods for predicting suicide
        risk are not sufficiently accurate, technological advances provide invaluable
        tools with which we may evolve toward a personalized, predictive approach.We
        aim to predict the short-term (1-week) risk of suicide by identifying changes
        in behavioral patterns characterized through real-time smartphone monitoring
        in a cohort of patients with suicidal ideation.We recruited 225 patients between
        February 2018 and March 2020 with a history of suicidal thoughts and behavior
        as part of the multicenter SmartCrisis study. Throughout 6 months of follow-up,
        we collected information on the risk of suicide or mental health crises. All
        participants underwent voluntary passive monitoring using data generated by
        their own smartphones, including distance walked and steps taken, time spent
        at home, and app usage. The algorithm constructs daily activity profiles for
        each patient according to these data and detects changes in the distribution
        of these profiles over time. Such changes are considered critical periods,
        and their relationship with suicide-risk events was tested.During follow-up,
        18 (8%) participants attempted suicide, and 14 (6.2%) presented to the emergency
        department for psychiatric care. The behavioral changes identified by the
        algorithm predicted suicide risk in a time frame of 1 week with an area under
        the curve of 0.78, indicating good accuracy.

      abstract: Masked pre-training removes random input dimensions and learns a model
        that can predict the missing values. Empirical results indicate that this
        intuitive form of self-supervised learning yields models that generalize very
        well to new domains. A theoretical understanding is, however, lacking. This
        paper shows that masked pre-training with a suitable cumulative scoring function
        corresponds to maximizing the model's marginal likelihood, which is de facto
        the Bayesian model selection measure of generalization. Beyond shedding light
        on the success of masked pre-training, this insight also suggests that Bayesian
        models can be trained with appropriately designed self-supervision. Empirically,
        we confirm the developed theory and explore the main learning principles of
        masked pre-training in large language models.

      abstract: We present a framework for transfer learning based on modular variational
        Gaussian processes (GP). We develop a module-based method that having a dictionary
        of well fitted GPs, each model being characterised by its hyperparameters,
        pseudo-inputs and their corresponding posterior densities, one could build
        ensemble GP models without revisiting any data. Our method avoids undesired
        data centralisation, reduces rising computational costs and allows the transfer
        of learned uncertainty metrics after training. We exploit the augmentation
        of high-dimensional integral operators based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence
        between stochastic processes to introduce an efficient lower bound under all
        the sparse variational GPs, with different complexity and even likelihood
        distribution. The method is also valid for multi-output GPs, learning correlations
        a posteriori between independent modules. Extensive results illustrate the
        usability of our framework in large-scale and multi-task experiments, also
        compared with the exact inference methods in the literature.

      abstract: Bayesian neural networks often approximate the weight-posterior with
        a Gaussian distribution. However, practical posteriors are often, even locally,
        highly non-Gaussian, and empirical performance deteriorates. We propose a
        simple parametric approximate posterior that adapts to the shape of the true
        posterior through a Riemannian metric that is determined by the log-posterior
        gradient. We develop a Riemannian Laplace approximation where samples naturally
        fall into weight-regions with low negative log-posterior. We show that these
        samples can be drawn by solving a system of ordinary differential equations,
        which can be done efficiently by leveraging the structure of the Riemannian
        metric and automatic differentiation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our
        approach consistently improves over the conventional Laplace approximation
        across tasks. We further show that, unlike the conventional Laplace approximation,
        our method is not overly sensitive to the choice of prior, which alleviates
        a practical pitfall of current approaches.

        change points is of the order of the dimension of the model parameters, drifts
        in the underlying distribution can be misidentified as changes. To overcome
        this limitation, we assume that the observations lie in a lower-dimensional
        manifold that admits a latent variable representation. In particular, we propose
        a hierarchical model that is computationally feasible, widely applicable to
        heterogeneous data and robust to missing instances. Additionally, the observations’

      abstract: We address the problem of continual learning in multi-task Gaussian
        process (GP) models for handling sequential input-output observations. Our
        approach extends the existing prior-posterior recursion of online Bayesian
        inference, i.e.\ past posterior discoveries become future prior beliefs, to
        the infinite functional space setting of GP. For a reason of scalability,
        we introduce variational inference together with an sparse approximation based
        on inducing inputs. As a consequence, we obtain tractable continual lower-bounds
        where two novel Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences intervene in a natural way.
        The key technical property of our method is the recursive reconstruction of
        conditional GP priors conditioned on the variational parameters learned so
        far. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel factorization of past variational
        distributions, where the predictive GP equation propagates the posterior uncertainty
        forward. We then demonstrate that it is possible to derive GP models over
        many types of sequential observations, either discrete or continuous and amenable
        to stochastic optimization. The continual inference approach is also applicable
        to scenarios where potential multi-channel or heterogeneous observations might
        appear. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method is fully scalable,
        shows a reliable performance and is robust to uncertainty error propagation
        over a plenty of synthetic and real-world datasets.

      abstract: Graph-based prediction is essential in NLP tasks such as temporal
        knowledge graph completion. A cardinal question in this field is, how to predict
        the future links, nodes, and attributes of a time-evolving attributed graph?
        Unfortunately, existing techniques assume that each link, node, and attribute
        prediction is independent, and fall short of predicting the appearance of
        new nodes that were not observed in the past. In this paper, we address two
        interrelated questions;(1) can we exploit task interdependence to improve
        prediction accuracy? and (2) can we predict new nodes with their attributes?
        We propose a unified framework that predicts node attributes and topology
        changes such as the appearance and disappearance of links and the emergence
        and loss of nodes. This frame-work comprises components for independent and
        interactive prediction and for predicting new nodes. Our experimental study
        using real-world data confirms that our interdependent prediction framework
        achieves higher accuracy than methods based on independent prediction.

      abstract: The Voter model is a well-studied stochastic process that models the
        invasion of a novel trait A (eg, a new opinion, social meme, genetic mutation,
        magnetic spin) in a network of individuals (agents, people, genes, particles)
        carrying an existing resident trait B. Individuals change traits by occasionally
        sampling the trait of a neighbor, while an invasion bias δ≥ 0 expresses the
        stochastic preference to adopt the novel trait A over the resident trait B.
        The strength of an invasion is measured by the probability that eventually
        the whole population adopts trait A, ie, the fixation probability. In more
        realistic settings, however, the invasion bias is not ubiquitous, but rather
        manifested only in parts of the network. For instance, when modeling the spread
        of a social trait, the invasion bias represents localized incentives. In this
        paper, we generalize the standard biased Voter model to the positional Voter
        model, in which the invasion bias is effectuated only on an arbitrary subset
        of the network nodes, called biased nodes. We study the ensuing optimization
        problem, which is, given a budget k, to choose k biased nodes so as to maximize
        the fixation probability of a randomly occurring invasion. We show that the
        problem is NP-hard both for finite δ and when δ→∞(strong bias), while the
        objective function is not submodular in either setting, indicating strong
        computational hardness. On the other hand, we show that, when δ→ 0 (weak bias),
        we can obtain a tight approximation in O (n^ 2ω) time, where ω is the matrix-multiplication
        exponent. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental evaluation
        of some proposed heuristics.

      abstract: Embedding a web-scale information network into a low-dimensional vector
        space facilitates tasks such as link prediction, classification, and visualization.
        Past research has addressed the problem of extracting such embeddings by adopting
        methods from words to graphs, without defining a clearly comprehensible graph-related
        objective. Yet, as we show, the objectives used in past works implicitly utilize
        similarity measures among graph nodes. In this paper, we carry the similarity
        orientation of previous works to its logical conclusion; we propose VERtex
        Similarity Embeddings (VERSE), a simple, versatile, and memory-efficient method
        that derives graph embeddings explicitly calibrated to preserve the distributions
        of a selected vertex-to-vertex similarity measure. VERSE learns such embeddings
        by training a single-layer neural network. While its default, scalable version
        does so via sampling similarity information …

      abstract: In a two-sided market with each agent ranking individuals on the other
        side according to their preferences, such as location or incentive, the stable
        marriage problem calls to find a perfect matching among the two sides such
        that no pair of agents prefers each other to their assigned matches. Recent
        studies show that the number of solutions can be large in practice. Yet the
        classic solution by the Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm is optimal for agents
        on the one side and pessimal for those on the other side. Some algorithms
        find a stable marriage that optimizes a measure of the cumulative satisfaction
        of all agents, such as egalitarian cost. However, in many real-world circumstances,
        a decision-maker needs to examine a set of solutions that are stable and attentive
        to both sides and choose among them based on expert knowledge. With such a
        disposition, it is necessary to identify a set of high-quality stable marriages

      abstract: 'Similarity search in high-dimensional metric spaces is routinely
        used in many applications including content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics,
        data mining, and recommender systems. Search can be accelerated by the use
        of an index. However, constructing a high-dimensional index can be quite expensive
        and may not pay off if the number of queries against the data is not large.
        In these circumstances, it is beneficial to construct an index adaptively,
        while responding to a query workload. Existing work on multidimensional adaptive
        indexing partitions space into orthotopes (i.e., hyperrectangular units).
        This approach, however, is highly ineffective in high-dimensional spaces.
        In this paper, we propose AV-tree: an alternative method for adaptive high-dimensional

      abstract: Recent research studied the problem of publishing microdata without
        revealing sensitive information, leading to the privacy preserving paradigms
        of k-anonymity and l-diversity. k-anonymity protects against the identification
        of an individual’s record. l-diversity, in addition, safeguards against the
        association of an individual with specific sensitive information. However,
        existing approaches suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks:(i)
        The information loss metrics are counter-intuitive and fail to capture data
        inaccuracies inflicted for the sake of privacy.(ii) l-diversity is solved
        by techniques developed for the simpler k-anonymity problem, which introduces
        unnecessary inaccuracies.(iii) The anonymization process is inefficient in
        terms of computation and I/O cost.In this paper we propose a framework for
        efficient privacy preservation that addresses these deficiencies. First, we
        focus on one-dimensional (ie, single attribute) quasiidentifiers, and study
        the properties of optimal solutions for k-anonymity and l-diversity, based
        on meaningful information loss metrics. Guided by these properties, we develop
        efficient heuristics to solve the one-dimensional problems in linear time.
        Finally, we generalize our solutions to multi-dimensional quasi-identifiers
        using space-mapping techniques. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that
        our techniques clearly outperform the state-of-the-art, in terms of execution
        time and information loss.

      abstract: Despite the intense interest towards realizing the Semantic Web vision,
        most existing RDF data management schemes are constrained in terms of efficiency
        and scalability. Still, the growing popularity of the RDF format arguably
        calls for an effort to offset these drawbacks. Viewed from a relational-database
        perspective, these constraints are derived from the very nature of the RDF
        data model, which is based on a triple format. Recent research has attempted
        to address these constraints using a vertical-partitioning approach, in which
        separate two-column tables are constructed for each property. However, as
        we show, this approach suffers from similar scalability drawbacks on queries
        that are not bound by RDF property value. In this paper, we propose an RDF
        storage scheme that uses the triple nature of RDF as an asset. This scheme
        enhances the vertical partitioning idea and takes it to its logical conclusion.

      abstract: 'Can we quickly explore large multidimensional data in main memory?
        Adaptive indexing responds to this need by building an index incrementally,
        in response to queries; in its default form, it indexes a single attribute
        or, in the presence of several attributes, one attribute per index level.
        Unfortunately, this approach falters when indexing spatial data objects, encountered
        in data exploration tasks involving multidimensional range queries. In this
        paper, we introduce the Adaptive Incremental R-tree (AIR-tree): the first
        method for the adaptive indexing of non-point spatial objects; the AIR-tree

        them to players to adjust the difficulty. This is part of a larger project
        to collect and adapt games in educational games for young children using a
        digital puzzle game designed for kindergarten. A genetic algorithm is used
        together with a difficulty measure to find a target number of solution sets
        and a large language model is used to communicate the rules in a narrative
        context. During testing the approach was able to find rules that approximate
        any given target difficulty within two dozen generations on average. The approach
        was combined with a large language model to create a narrative puzzle game
        where players have to host a dinner for animals that can't get along. Future
        experiments will try to improve evaluation, specialize the language model
        on children's literature, and collect multi-modal data from players to guide
        adaptation.

        unable to reach human-level performance across all levels, the differences
        in terms of behaviour between levels are highly correlated to the differences

      abstract: Green and white asparagus are quite different crops but can be harvested
        from the same plant. They have distinct morphological differences due to their
        mode of cultivation and they are characterised by having contrasting appearance
        and flavour. Significant chemical differences are therefore expected. Spears
        from three varieties of both green and white forms, harvested in two consecutive
        seasons were analysed using headspace GC-MS and LC-MS with an untargeted metabolomic
        workflow. Mainly C5 and C8 alcohols and aldehydes, and phenolic compounds
        were more abundant in green spears, whereas benzenoids, monoterpenes, unsaturated
        aldehydes and steroidal saponins were more abundant in white ones. Previously
        reported key asparagus volatiles and non-volatiles were detected at similar
        or not significantly different levels in the two asparagus types. Spatial
        metabolomics revealed also that many volatiles with known positive aroma attributes
        were significantly more abundant in the upper parts of the spears and showed
        a decreasing trend towards the base. These findings provide valuable insights
        into the metabolome of raw asparagus, the contrasts between green and white

      abstract: Universal Neural Style Transfer (NST) methods are capable of performing
        style transfer of arbitrary styles in a style-agnostic manner via feature
        transforms in (almost) real-time. Even though their unimodal parametric style
        modeling approach has been proven adequate to transfer a single style from
        relatively simple images, they are usually not capable of effectively handling
        more complex styles, producing significant artifacts, as well as reducing
        the quality of the synthesized textures in the stylized image. To overcome
        these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel universal NST approach
        that separately models each sub-style that exists in a given style image (or
        a collection of style images). This allows for better modeling the subtle
        style differences within the same style image and then using the most appropriate
        sub-style (or mixtures of different sub-styles) to stylize the content image.
        The ability of the proposed approach to a) perform a wide range of different
        stylizations using the sub-styles that exist in one style image, while giving
        the ability to the user to appropriate mix the different sub-styles, b) automatically
        match the most appropriate sub-style to different semantic regions of the
        content image, improving existing state-of-the-art universal NST approaches,
        and c) detecting and transferring the sub-styles from collections of images
        are demonstrated through extensive experiments.

      abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-established in medical
        imaging tackling various tasks. %including image registration.  However, their
        performance is limited due to their incapacity to capture long spatial correspondences
        within images. Recently proposed deep-learning-based registration methods
        try to overcome this limitation by assuming that transformers are better at
        modeling long-range displacements thanks to the nature of the self-attention
        mechanism. Even though existing transformers are already considered state-of-the-art
        in image registration, there is no extensive validation of the key premise.
        In this work, we test this hypothesis by evaluating the target registration
        error as a function of the displacement. Our findings show that transformers
        outperform CNNs on a public dataset of lung 3D CT images with large displacements.
        Yet, the performance difference stems from transformers registering small
        displacements with higher accuracy. Contrary to previous beliefs, we find

      abstract: Image registration aims to find geometric transformations that align
        images. Most algorithmic and deep learning-based methods solve the registration
        problem by minimizing a loss function, consisting of a similarity metric comparing
        the aligned images, and a regularization term ensuring smoothness of the transformation.
        Existing similarity metrics like Euclidean Distance or Normalized Cross-Correlation
        focus on aligning pixel intensity values or correlations, giving difficulties
        with low intensity contrast, noise, and ambiguous matching. We propose a semantic
        similarity metric for image registration, focusing on aligning image areas
        based on semantic correspondence instead. Our approach learns dataset-specific
        features that drive the optimization of a learning-based registration model.
        We train both an unsupervised approach extracting features with an auto-encoder,
        and a semi-supervised approach using …

      abstract: ' Many universal Neural Style Transfer (NST) methods have been recently
        proposed. These methods are capable of transferring arbitrary styles in a
        style-agnostic manner by employing the appropriate feature transformations.
        Despite their apparent effectiveness when used to transfer a single style
        from relatively simple images, they are usually not capable of effectively
        handling more complex styles, producing artifacts, as well as reducing the
        quality of the synthesized textures in the stylized image. In this paper,
        we propose a novel universal style transfer method that separately models
        each sub-style that exists in a given style image, overcoming these limitations
        to a great extent. In this way, the proposed method is capable of detecting

      abstract: Realistic synthetic time series data of sufficient length enables
        practical applications in time series modeling tasks, such as forecasting,
        but remains a challenge. In this paper we present PSA-GAN, a generative adversarial
        network (GAN) that generates long time series samples of high quality using
        progressive growing of GANs and self-attention. We show that PSA-GAN can be
        used to reduce the error in several downstream forecasting tasks over baselines
        that only use real data. We also introduce a Frechet-Inception Distance-like
        score for time series, Context-FID, assessing the quality of synthetic time
        series samples. We find that Context-FID is indicative for downstream performance.
        Therefore, Context-FID could be a useful tool to develop time series GAN models.

        resulting in a wealth of innovative tools, frameworks and technical approaches.
        Less attention has been paid to the design process. Namely, how can it ensure
        that the created DSL realises the expected benefits? This paper seeks to answer
        this question when designing DSLs for highly specialised domains subject to
        resource constraints, an evolving application domain, and scarce user participation.

        small set of narratives that capture the essential claims related to a given
        topic. Understanding and visualizing these narratives can facilitate more
        informed debates on social media. As a first step towards systematically identifying
        the underlying narratives on social media, we introduce PAPYER, a fine-grained

      abstract: Recently, advances in differential volumetric rendering enabled significant
        breakthroughs in the photo-realistic and fine-detailed reconstruction of complex
        3D scenes, which is key for many virtual reality applications. However, in
        the context of augmented reality, one may also wish to effect semantic manipulations
        or augmentations of objects within a scene. To this end, we propose a volumetric
        framework for (i) disentangling or separating, the volumetric representation
        of a given foreground object from the background, and (ii) semantically manipulating
        the foreground object, as well as the background. Our framework takes as input
        a set of 2D masks specifying the desired foreground object for training views,
        together with the associated 2D views and poses, and produces a foreground-background
        disentanglement that respects the surrounding illumination, reflections, and
        partial occlusions, which can be applied to both training and novel views.
        Our method enables the separate control of pixel color and depth as well as
        3D similarity transformations of both the foreground and background objects.
        We subsequently demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a number
        of downstream manipulation tasks including object camouflage, non-negative
        3D object inpainting, 3D object translation, 3D object inpainting, and 3D
        text-based object manipulation. Full results are given in our project webpage

      abstract: The ability to assess the robustness of image classifiers to a diverse
        set of manipulations is essential to their deployment in the real world. Recently,
        semantic manipulations of real images have been considered for this purpose,
        as they may not arise using standard adversarial settings. However, such semantic
        manipulations are often limited to style, color or attribute changes. While
        expressive, these manipulations do not consider the full capacity of a pretrained
        generator to affect adversarial image manipulations. In this work, we aim
        at leveraging the full capacity of a pretrained image generator to generate
        highly detailed, diverse and photorealistic image manipulations. Inspired
        by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method called Adversarial
        Pivotal Tuning (APT). APT first finds a pivot latent space input to a pretrained
        generator that best reconstructs an input image. It then adjusts the weights
        of the generator to create small, but semantic, manipulations which fool a
        pretrained classifier. Crucially, APT changes both the input and the weights
        of the pretrained generator, while preserving its expressive latent editing
        capability, thus allowing the use of its full capacity in creating semantic
        adversarial manipulations. We demonstrate that APT generates a variety of
        semantic image manipulations, which preserve the input image class, but which
        fool a variety of pretrained classifiers. We further demonstrate that classifiers
        trained to be robust to other robustness benchmarks, are not robust to our
        generated manipulations and propose an approach to improve the robustness
        towards our generated manipulations. Code available at …

      abstract: The use of deep learning techniques has achieved significant progress
        for program synthesis from input-output examples. However, when the program
        semantics become more complex, it still remains a challenge to synthesize
        programs that are consistent with the specification. In this work, we propose
        SED, a neural program generation framework that incorporates synthesis, execution,
        and debugging stages. Instead of purely relying on the neural program synthesizer
        to generate the final program, SED first produces initial programs using the
        neural program synthesizer component, then utilizes a neural program debugger
        to iteratively repair the generated programs. The integration of the debugger
        component enables SED to modify the programs based on the execution results
        and specification, which resembles the coding process of human programmers.
        On Karel, a challenging input-output program synthesis benchmark, SED reduces
        the error rate of the neural program synthesizer itself by a considerable
        margin, and outperforms the standard beam search for decoding.

        for digital decision support tools. We investigate how Recurrent Neural Networks
        (RNNs) can be used for Short Term Blood Glucose (STBG) prediction and compare
        the RNNs to conventional time-series forecasting using Autoregressive Integrated
        Moving Average (ARIMA). A prediction horizon up to 90 min into the future
        is considered. In this context, we evaluate both population-based and patient-specific
        RNNs and contrast them to patient-specific ARIMA models and a simple baseline
        predicting future observations as the last observed. We find that the population-based
        RNN model is the best performing model across the considered prediction horizons
        without the need of patient-specific data. This demonstrates the potential
        of RNNs for STBG prediction in …

      abstract: 'Travel restrictions have proven to be an effective strategy to control
        the spread of the COVID-19 epidemics, in part because they help delay disease
        propagation across territories. The question, however, as to how different
        types of travel behaviour, from commuting to holiday-related travel, contribute
        to the spread of infectious diseases remains open. Here, we address this issue
        by using factorization techniques to decompose the temporal network describing
        mobility flows throughout 2020 into interpretable components. Our results
        are based on two mobility datasets: the first is gathered from Danish mobile
        network operators; the second originates from the Facebook Data-For-Good project.
        We find that mobility patterns can be described as the aggregation of three

      abstract: Modeling and simulation techniques are today extensively used both
        in industry and science. Parts of larger systems are, however, typically modeled
        and simulated by different techniques, tools, and algorithms. In addition,
        experts from different disciplines use various modeling and simulation techniques.
        Both these facts make it difficult to study coupled heterogeneous systems.Co-simulation
        is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system
        can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential
        and interdisciplinary nature, co-simulation is being studied in different
        disciplines but with limited sharing of findings.In this survey, we study
        and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal
        of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges.To study

        increase automation and advance towards Smart Manufacturing. Manufacturing
        DTs have been implemented at different hierarchical levels, ranging from system
        of systems to unit level. Increasing computational capacity and data exchange
        rates can enable DT implementations for real-time applications. Several literature

        is most applicable. Simultaneously, the challenges to engineer DTs with real-time

      abstract: Object-oriented design methods are commonplace in computing systems
        development, but are often dismissed as' boxes & arrows'. If systems developers
        are to gain full advantage from such methods, they should be able to achieve
        designs that are not merely the subject of heated argument, but can be improved
        by careful, rigorous & machine-supported analysis. This book describes an
        object-oriented design approach that combines the benefits of abstract modelling
        with the analytic power of formal methods, to give designs that can be rigorously
        validated & assured with automated support. Aimed at software architects,
        designers & developers as well as computer scientists, no prior knowledge
        of formal methods is assumed. The elements of functional modelling are introduced
        using numerous examples & exercises, industrial case studies & experience

      abstract: The term “System of Systems” (SoS) has been used since the 1950s to
        describe systems that are composed of independent constituent systems, which
        act jointly towards a common goal through the synergism between them. Examples
        of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production,
        and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence,
        heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article
        focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field.
        A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify
        several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified
        by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS
        applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically
        reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural …

        role in our societies, across different domains, from elderly care to agricultural
        solutions. Therefore, it is crucial that their behaviour is thoroughly tested,
        to provide guarantees as to their intended safe operation around humans, other
        robots, equipment, and environment. Such testing should be performed throughout
        the different development stages, and is associated with several challenges
        that relate to cost, time, and resource management. In this paper, we address
        these issues by proposing a Digital Twin (DT) enabled approach that can be
        used in various development stages of robots, from pure simulation, to gradual
        introduction of hardware, to a complete robot with its DT. Additionally, it

      abstract: 'This report describes the state of the art in verifiable computation.
        The problem being solved is the following: The Verifiable Computation Problem
        (Verifiable Computing Problem) Suppose we have two computing agents. The first
        agent is the verifier, and the second agent is the prover. The verifier wants
        the prover to perform a computation. The verifier sends a description of the
        computation to the prover. Once the prover has completed the task, the prover
        returns the output to the verifier. The output will contain proof. The verifier
        can use this proof to check if the prover computed the output correctly. The
        check is not required to verify the algorithm used in the computation. Instead,
        it is a check that the prover computed the output using the computation specified
        by the verifier. The effort required for the check should be much less than
        that required to perform the computation. This state-of-the-art report surveys
        128 papers from the literature comprising more than 4,000 pages. Other papers
        and books were surveyed but were omitted. The papers surveyed were overwhelmingly

      abstract: The ability to move production between different geographical locations
        has recently become more important, due to the increasing need for sustainability
        and faster response times, complying with local regulations, and dealing with
        brittle international supply chains. To this end, the movable factory concept
        has been put forward, which is defined as mobile production units that can
        be installed near the customer’s location. Unfortunately, industrial paradigms
        such as Industry 4.0 make little if any notice of movable factories but instead
        focus on the digitalization of their fixed counterparts. In the form of a
        systematic literature review, this paper breaks down the concept of the movable

      abstract: Evaluating hardware for deep learning is challenging. The models can
        take days or more to run, the datasets are generally larger than what fits
        into memory, and the models are sensitive to interference. Scaling this up
        to a large amount of experiments and keeping track of both software and hardware
        metrics thus poses real difficulties as these problems are exacerbated by
        sheer experimental data volume. This paper explores some of the data management
        and exploration difficulties when working on machine learning systems research.
        We introduce our solution in the form of an open-source framework built on
        top of a machine learning lifecycle platform. Additionally, we introduce a
        web environment for visualizing and exploring experimental data.

      abstract: Modern hardware is abundantly parallel and increasingly heterogeneous.
        The numerous processing cores have non-uniform access latencies to the main
        memory and to the processor caches, which causes variability in the communication
        costs. Unfortunately, database systems mostly assume that all processing cores
        are the same and that microarchitecture differences are not significant enough
        to appear in critical database execution paths. As we demonstrate in this
        paper, however, hardware heterogeneity does appear in the critical path and
        conventional database architectures achieve suboptimal and even worse, unpredictable
        performance. We perform a detailed performance analysis of OLTP deployments
        in servers with multiple cores per CPU (multicore) and multiple CPUs per server
        (multisocket). We compare different database deployment strategies where we
        vary the number and size of independent database instances running on a single
        server, from a single shared-everything instance to fine-grained shared-nothing
        configurations. We quantify the impact of non-uniform hardware on various
        deployments by (a) examining how efficiently each deployment uses the available
        hardware resources and (b) measuring the impact of distributed transactions
        and skewed requests on different workloads. Finally, we argue in favor of
        shared-nothing deployments that are topology- and workload-aware and take
        advantage of fast on-chip communication between islands of cores on the same
        socket.

      abstract: Nowadays, high-performance transaction processing applications increasingly
        run on multisocket multicore servers. Such architectures exhibit non-uniform
        memory access latency as well as non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately,
        traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for
        uniform inter-core communication speeds. This causes unpredictable access
        latencies in the critical path. While lack of data locality may be a minor
        nuisance on systems with fewer than 4 processors, it becomes a serious scalability
        limitation on larger systems due to accesses to centralized data structures.
        In this paper, we propose ATraPos, a storage manager design that is aware
        of the non-uniform access latencies of multisocket systems. ATraPos achieves
        good data locality by carefully partitioning the data as well as internal
        data structures (e.g., state information) to the available processors …

      abstract: Most machine learning proposals in the Internet of Things (IoT) are
        designed and evaluated on pre-processed datasets, where data acquisition and
        cleaning steps are often considered a black box. In addition, IoT environments
        have numerous challenges related to acquiring data from sensors, where sensitive
        data can be threatened by malicious users who seek to interfere with the communication
        channel or storage. Additionally, sensor data can also be affected by noise.
        Therefore, differentiating the type of threat/anomaly requires additional
        energy and computational resources. We propose to carry out data cleaning/anomaly
        techniques on the IoT device itself, not in the cloud servers but closer to
        the data source. Therefore, the IoT device sends trusted data to the Cloud.
        Among the benefits of this is the considerable reduction in the cost of implementation
        due to less movement of data between IoT devices and the …

      abstract: Scaling the performance of shared-everything transaction processing
        systems to highly-parallel multicore hardware remains a challenge for database
        system designers. Recent proposals alleviate locking and logging bottlenecks
        in the system, leaving page latching as the next potential problem. To tackle
        the page latching problem, we propose physiological partitioning (PLP). The
        PLP design applies logical-only partitioning, maintaining the desired properties
        of shared-everything designs, and introduces a multi-rooted B+Tree index structure
        (MRBTree) which enables the partitioning of the accesses at the physical page
        level. Logical partitioning and MRBTrees together ensure that all accesses
        to a given index page come from a single thread and, hence, can be entirely
        latch-free; an extended design makes heap page accesses thread-private as
        well. Eliminating page latching allows us to simplify key code paths …

      abstract: This paper presents stability and control analysis of a satellite
        on a near polar orbit subject to the gravity torque. The satellite is actuated
        by a set of mutually perpendicular coils. The concept is that interaction
        between the Earth’s magnetic field and a magnetic field generated by the coils
        results in a mechanical torque used for attitude corrections. Magnetic actuation
        due to its simplicity and power efficiency is attractive on small, inexpensive
        satellites. This principle is however inherently nonlinear, and difficult
        to use since the control torque can only be generated perpendicular to the
        geomagnetic field vector. This paper shows that three-axis control can be
        achieved with magnetorquers as sole actuators in a low Earth near polar orbit.
        It considers the problem from a time-varying, nonlinear system point of view
        and suggests controllers for three-axis stabilization. A stability analysis

      abstract: Modern wind turbine controllers use wind speed information to improve
        power production and reduce loads on the turbine components. The turbine top
        wind speed measurement is unfortunately imprecise and not a good representative
        of the rotor effective wind speed. Consequently, many different model-based
        algorithms have been proposed that are able to estimate the wind speed using
        common turbine measurements. In this paper, we present a concise yet comprehensive
        analysis and comparison of these techniques, reviewing their advantages and
        drawbacks. We implement these techniques and compare the results on both aero-servo-elastic
        turbine simulations and real turbine field experiments in different wind scenarios.

      abstract: The primary purpose of this work was to develop control laws for three
        axis stabilization of a magnetic actuated satellite. This was achieved by
        a combination of linear and nonlinear system theory. In order to reach this
        goal new theoretical results were produced in both fields. The focus of the
        work was on the class of periodic systems reflecting orbital motion of the
        satellite. In addition to a theoretical treatment, the thesis contains a large
        portion of application considerations. The controllers developed were implemented
        for the Danish Ørsted satellite. The control concept considered was that interaction
        between the Earth's magnetic field and a magnetic field generated by a set
        of coils in the satellite can be used for actuation. Magnetic torquing was
        found attractive for generation of control torques on small satellites, since
        magnetic control systems are relatively lightweight, require low power and
        are inexpensive. However, this principle is inherently nonlinear and difficult
        to use, because control torques can only be generated perpendicular to the
        geomagnetic field vector. So far, this has prevented control in all three
        axes using magnetorquers only. A fact that the geomagnetic field changed periodically

        Required pointing accuracy of small, inexpensive satellites is often relatively

        the interaction between the Earth’s magnetic eld and the magnetic eld generated

        in a plane perpendicular to the local geomagnetic eld vector; therefore, the

      abstract: Arrest of ongoing movements is an integral part of executing motor
        programs. Behavioral arrest may happen upon termination of a variety of goal-directed
        movements or as a global motor arrest either in the context of fear or in
        response to salient environmental cues. The neuronal circuits that bridge
        with the executive motor circuits to implement a global motor arrest are poorly

        neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) in mice arrests all ongoing
        movements while simultaneously causing apnea and bradycardia. This global

        of movement followed by a short-latency continuation from where it was paused.

        in soil is often challenging due to the roots being difficult to access and
        the use of time consuming manual methods. Rhizotrons allow visual inspection
        of root growth through transparent surfaces. Agronomists currently manually
        label photographs of roots obtained from rhizotrons using a line-intersect
        method to obtain root length density and rooting depth measurements which
        are essential for their experiments. We investigate the effectiveness of an

        train, validate and test the system and compare against a baseline built using
        the Frangi vesselness filter. We obtain metrics using manual annotations and

      abstract: The accelerated development of machine learning methods, primarily
        deep learning, are causal to the recent breakthroughs in medical image analysis
        and computer aided intervention. The resource consumption of deep learning
        models in terms of amount of training data, compute and energy costs are known
        to be massive. These large resource costs can be barriers in deploying these
        models in clinics, globally. To address this, there are cogent efforts within
        the machine learning community to introduce notions of resource efficiency.
        For instance, using quantisation to alleviate memory consumption. While most
        of these methods are shown to reduce the resource utilisation, they could
        come at a cost in performance. In this work, we probe into the trade-off between
        resource consumption and performance, specifically, when dealing with models
        that are used in critical settings such as in clinics.

        many tasks thought to be out of reach of AI. These ML methods can often be
        compute hungry, energy intensive, and result in significant carbon emissions,
        a known driver of anthropogenic climate change. Additionally, the platforms
        on which ML systems run are associated with environmental impacts including
        and beyond carbon emissions. The solution lionized by both industry and the
        ML community to improve the environmental sustainability of ML is to increase
        the efficiency with which ML systems operate in terms of both compute and
        energy consumption. In this perspective, we argue that efficiency alone is
        not enough to make ML as a technology environmentally sustainable. We do so
        by presenting three high level discrepancies between the effect of efficiency
        on the environmental sustainability of ML when considering the many variables
        which it interacts with. In doing so, we comprehensively demonstrate, at multiple
        levels of granularity both technical and non-technical reasons, why efficiency
        is not enough to fully remedy the environmental impacts of ML. Based on this,
        we present and argue for systems thinking as a viable path towards improving
        the environmental sustainability of ML holistically.

      abstract: The rapid growth of materials chemistry data, driven by advancements
        in large-scale radiation facilities as well as laboratory instruments, has
        outpaced conventional data analysis and modelling methods, which can require
        enormous manual effort. To address this bottleneck, we investigate the application
        of supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques for scattering
        and spectroscopy data analysis in materials chemistry research. Our perspective
        focuses on ML applications in powder diffraction (PD), pair distribution function
        (PDF), small-angle scattering (SAS), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and
        X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data, but the lessons that we learn are
        generally applicable across materials chemistry. We review the ability of
        ML to efficiently and accurately identify physical and structural models and
        extract information from experimental data. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges
        associated with supervised ML and highlight how unsupervised ML can mitigate
        these limitations, thus enhancing experimental materials chemistry data analysis.
        Our perspective emphasises the transformative potential of ML in materials
        chemistry characterisation and identifies promising directions for future
        applications. The perspective aims to guide newcomers to ML-based experimental
        data analysis, alerting them to the potential pitfalls and offering guidance
        for success.

      abstract: We present a system for head motion tracking in 3D brain imaging.
        The system is based on facial surface reconstruction and tracking using a
        structured light (SL) scanning principle. The system is designed to fit into
        narrow 3D medical scanner geometries limiting the field of view. It is tested
        in a clinical setting on the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT), Siemens
        PET scanner with a head phantom and volunteers. The SL system is compared
        to a commercial optical tracking system, the Polaris Vicra system, from NDI
        based on translatory and rotary ground truth motions of the head phantom.
        The accuracy of the systems was similar, with root mean square (rms) errors
        of 0.09° for ±20° axial rotations, and rms errors of 0.24 mm for ± 25 mm translations.
        Tests were made using 1) a light emitting diode (LED) based miniaturized video
        projector, the Pico projector from Texas Instruments, and 2) a customized

      abstract: When doctors are trained to diagnose a specific disease, they learn
        faster when presented with cases in order of increasing difficulty. This creates
        the need for automatically estimating how difficult it is for doctors to classify
        a given case. In this paper, we introduce methods for estimating how hard
        it is for a doctor to diagnose a case represented by a medical image, both
        when ground truth difficulties are available for training, and when they are
        not. Our methods are based on embeddings obtained with deep metric learning.
        Additionally, we introduce a practical method for obtaining ground truth human
        difficulty for each image case in a dataset using self-assessed certainty.
        We apply our methods to two different medical datasets, achieving high Kendall
        rank correlation coefficients on both, showing that we outperform existing
        methods by a large margin on our problem and data.

      abstract: The identification of congenital inner ear malformations is a challenging
        task even for experienced clinicians. In this study, we present the first
        automated method for classifying congenital inner ear malformations. We generate
        3D meshes of the cochlear structure in 364 normative and 107 abnormal anatomies
        using a segmentation model trained exclusively with normative anatomies. Given
        the sparsity and natural unbalance of such datasets, we use an unsupervised
        method for learning a feature representation of the 3D meshes using DeepDiffusion.
        In this approach, we use the PointNet architecture for the network-based unsupervised
        feature learning and combine it with the diffusion distance on a feature manifold.
        This unsupervised approach captures the variability of the different cochlear
        shapes and generates clusters in the latent space which faithfully represent
        the variability observed in the data. We report a mean average precision of
        0.77 over the seven main pathological subgroups diagnosed by an ENT (Ear,
        Nose, and Throat) surgeon specialized in congenital inner ear malformations.

      abstract: 'Timely detection of surface damages on wind turbine blades is imperative
        for minimizing downtime and avoiding possible catastrophic structural failures.
        With recent advances in drone technology, a large number of high-resolution
        images of wind turbines are routinely acquired and subsequently analyzed by
        experts to identify imminent damages. Automated analysis of these inspection
        images with the help of machine learning algorithms can reduce the inspection
        cost. In this work, we develop a deep learning-based automated damage suggestion
        system for subsequent analysis of drone inspection images. Experimental results
        demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve almost human-level precision
        in terms of suggested damage location and types on wind turbine blades. We
        further demonstrate that for relatively small training sets, advanced data
        augmentation during deep learning training can better generalize the trained
        model, providing a significant gain in precision. Dataset:           doi:10.17632/hd96prn3nc.1         '

      abstract: A method for implicit surface reconstruction is proposed. The novelty
        in this paper is the adaption of Markov Random Field regularization of a distance
        field. The Markov Random Field formulation allows us to integrate both knowledge
        about the type of surface we wish to reconstruct (the prior) and knowledge
        about data (the observation model) in an orthogonal fashion. Local models
        that account for both scene-specific knowledge and physical properties of
        the scanning device are described. Furthermore, how the optimal distance field
        can be computed is demonstrated using conjugate gradients, sparse Cholesky
        factorization, and a multiscale iterative optimization scheme. The method
        is demonstrated on a set of scanned human heads and, both in terms of accuracy
        and the ability to close holes, the proposed method is shown to have similar
        or superior performance when compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms.

        motion registration is crucial for accurate motion correction (MC) in PET

      abstract: Neural implicit surfaces have emerged as an effective, learnable representation
        for shapes of arbitrary topology. However, representing open surfaces remains
        a challenge. Different methods, such as unsigned distance fields (UDF), have
        been proposed to tackle this issue, but a general solution remains elusive.
        The generalized winding number (GWN), which is often used to distinguish interior
        points from exterior points of 3D shapes, is arguably the most promising approach.
        The GWN changes smoothly in regions where there is a hole in the surface,
        but it is discontinuous at points on the surface. Effectively, this means
        that it can be used in lieu of an implicit surface representation while providing
        information about holes, but, unfortunately, it does not provide information
        about the distance to the surface necessary for e.g. ray tracing, and special
        care must be taken when implementing surface reconstruction …

      abstract: We propose a novel method for automatic ROI extraction. The method
        is implemented and tested for isolating the inner ear in full head CT scans.
        Extracting the ROI with high precision is in this case critical for surgical
        insertion of cochlear implants. Different parameters, such as CT equipment,
        image quality, anatomical variation, and the subject’s head orientation during
        scanning make robust ROI extraction challenging. We propose to use state-of-the-art
        communicative multi-agent reinforcement learning to overcome these difficulties.
        We specify landmarks specifically designed to robustly extract orientation
        parameters such that all ROIs have the same orientation and include the relevant
        anatomy across the dataset. 140 full head CT scans were used to develop and
        test the ROI extraction pipeline. We report an average overall estimated error
        for landmark localization of 1. 07 mm. Extracted ROI presented an intersection
        over union of 0. 84 and a Dice similarity coefficient of 0. 91.

      abstract: A method for building statistical point distribution models is proposed.
        The novelty in this paper is the adaption of Markov random field regularization
        of the correspondence field over the set of shapes. The new approach leads
        to a generative model that produces highly homogeneous polygonized shapes
        and improves the capability of reconstruction of the training data. Furthermore,
        the method leads to an overall reduction in the total variance of the point
        distribution model. Thus, it finds correspondence between semi-landmarks that
        are highly correlated in the shape tangent space. The method is demonstrated
        on a set of human ear canals extracted from 3D-laser scans.

      abstract: The number of pedestrians walking the streets or gathered in public
        spaces is a valuable piece of information for shop owners, city governments,
        event organizers and many others. However, automatic counting that takes place
        day and night is challenging due to changing lighting conditions and the complexity
        of scenes with many people occluding one another. To address these challenges,
        this paper introduces the use of a stereo thermal camera setup for pedestrian
        counting. We investigate the reconstruction of 3D points in a pedestrian street
        with two thermal cameras and propose an algorithm for pedestrian counting
        based on clustering and tracking of the 3D point clouds. The method is tested
        on two five-minute video sequences captured at a public event with a moderate
        density of pedestrians and heavy occlusions. The counting performance is compared
        to the manually annotated ground truth and shows success rates of 95.4% and
        99.1% for the two sequences.

      abstract: The increasing demand for marine monitoring calls for robust automated
        systems to support researchers in gathering information from marine ecosystems.
        This includes computer vision based marine organism detection and species
        classification systems. Current state-of-the-art marine vision systems are
        based on CNNs, which in nature require a relatively large amount of varied
        training data. In this paper we present a new publicly available underwater
        dataset with annotated image sequences of fish, crabs, and starfish captured
        in brackish water with varying visibility. The dataset is called the Brackish
        Dataset and it is the first part of a planned long term monitoring of the
        marine species visiting the strait where the cameras are permanently mounted.
        To the best of our knowledge, this is the first annotated underwater image
        dataset captured in temperate brackish waters. In order to obtain a baseline
        performance for future reference, the YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 CNNs were fine-tuned
        and tested on the Brackish Dataset.

      abstract: The world of sports intrinsically involves fast and accurate motion
        that is not only challenging for competitors to master, but can be difficult
        for coaches and trainers to analyze, and for audiences to follow. The nature
        of most sports means that monitoring by the use of sensors or other devices
        fixed to players or equipment is generally not possible. This provides a rich
        set of opportunities for the application of computer vision techniques to
        help the competitors, coaches and audience. This paper discusses a selection
        of current commercial applications that use computer vision for sports analysis,
        and highlights some of the topics that are currently being addressed in the
        research community. A summary of on-line datasets to support research in this
        area is included.

        human-induced events annotated with single timestamps. In this paper, we propose
        a novel loss function that specifically considers the temporal context naturally
        present around each action, rather than focusing on the single annotated frame
        to spot. We benchmark our loss on a large dataset of soccer videos, SoccerNet,
        and achieve an improvement of 12.8% over the baseline. We show the generalization
        capability of our loss for generic activity proposals and detection on ActivityNet,
        by spotting the beginning and the end of each activity. Furthermore, we provide
        an extended ablation study and display challenging cases for action spotting
        in soccer videos. Finally, we qualitatively illustrate how our loss induces
        a precise temporal understanding of actions and show how such semantic knowledge
        can be used for automatic highlights generation.

      abstract: Thermal cameras are passive sensors that capture the infrared radiation
        emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero. This type of
        camera was originally developed as a surveillance and night vision tool for
        the military, but recently the price has dropped, significantly opening up
        a broader field of applications. Deploying this type of sensor in vision systems
        eliminates the illumination problems of normal greyscale and RGB cameras.
        This survey provides an overview of the current applications of thermal cameras.
        Applications include animals, agriculture, buildings, gas detection, industrial,
        and military applications, as well as detection, tracking, and recognition
        of humans. Moreover, this survey describes the nature of thermal radiation
        and the technology of thermal cameras.

      abstract: To improve the ability of language models to handle Natural Language
        Processing (NLP) tasks and intermediate step of pre-training has recently
        beenintroduced. In this setup, one takes a pre-trained language model, trains
        it ona (set of) NLP dataset (s), and then finetunes it for a target task.
        It isknown that the selection of relevant transfer tasks is important, but
        recentlysome work has shown substantial performance gains by doing intermediatetraining
        on a very large set of datasets. Most previous work uses generativelanguage
        models or only focuses on one or a couple of tasks and uses acarefully curated
        setup. We compare intermediate training with one or manytasks in a setup where
        the choice of datasets is more arbitrary; we use allSemEval 2023 text-based
        tasks. We reach performance improvements for most taskswhen using intermediate
        training. Gains are higher when doing intermediatetraining on single tasks
        than all tasks if the right transfer taskis identified. Dataset smoothing
        and heterogeneous batching did not lead torobust gains in our setup.

      abstract: 'Gender prediction has typically focused on lexical and social network
        features, yielding good performance, but making systems highly language-,
        topic-, and platform-dependent. Cross-lingual embeddings circumvent some of
        these limitations, but capture gender-specific style less. We propose an alternative:
        bleaching text, i.e., transforming lexical strings into more abstract features.
        This study provides evidence that such features allow for better transfer
        across languages. Moreover, we present a first study on the ability of humans
        to perform cross-lingual gender prediction. We find that human predictive

        task as sequence labeling, taking advantage of a multi-label aware encoding

        BeeSL is fast, accurate, end-to-end, and unlike current methods does not require
        any external knowledge base or preprocessing tools. BeeSL outperforms the
        current best system (Li et al., 2019) on the Genia 2011 benchmark by 1.57%
        absolute F1 score reaching 60.22% F1, establishing a new state of the art
        for the task. Importantly, we also provide first results on biomedical event

      abstract: The increasing number of benchmarks for Natural Language Processing

        methods that can handle job-related tasks such as skill extraction, skill
        classification, job title classification, and de-identification. While some
        approaches have been developed that are specific to the job market domain,
        there is a lack of generalized, multilingual models and benchmarks for these
        tasks. In this study, we introduce a language model called ESCOXLM-R, based
        on XLM-R, which uses domain-adaptive pre-training on the European Skills,
        Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy, covering 27 languages.
        The pre-training objectives for ESCOXLM-R include dynamic masked language
        modeling and a novel additional objective for inducing multilingual taxonomical
        ESCO relations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of ESCOXLM-R on
        6 sequence labeling and 3 classification tasks in 4 languages and find that
        it achieves state-of-the-art results on 6 out of 9 datasets. Our analysis
        reveals that ESCOXLM-R performs better on short spans and outperforms XLM-R
        on entity-level and surface-level span-F1, likely due to ESCO containing short
        skill and occupation titles, and encoding information on the entity-level.

      abstract: Current machine learning models have shown high efficiency in solving
        a wide variety of real-world problems. However, their black box character
        poses a major challenge for the comprehensibility and traceability of the
        underlying decision-making strategies. As a remedy, numerous post-hoc and
        self-explanation methods have been developed to interpret the models’ behavior.
        Those methods, in addition, enable the identification of artifacts that, inherent
        in the training data, can be erroneously learned by the model as class-relevant
        features. In this work, we provide a detailed case study of a representative

      abstract: We propose a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for land cover
        mapping in remote sensing images, with a focus on urban areas. In remote sensing,
        class imbalance represents often a problem for tasks like land cover mapping,
        as small objects get less prioritised in an effort to achieve the best overall
        accuracy. We propose a novel approach to achieve high overall accuracy, while
        still achieving good accuracy for small objects. Quantifying the uncertainty
        on a pixel scale is another challenge in remote sensing, especially when using
        CNNs. In this paper we use recent advances in measuring uncertainty for CNNs
        and evaluate their quality both qualitatively and quantitatively in a remote
        sensing context. We demonstrate our ideas on different deep architectures
        including patch-based and so-called pixel-to-pixel approaches, as well as
        their combination, by classifying each pixel in a set of aerial images covering
        Vaihingen, Germany. The results show that we obtain an overall classification
        accuracy of 87%. The corresponding F1-score for the small object class" car"

      abstract: Analyzing deep neural networks (DNNs) via information plane (IP) theory
        has gained tremendous attention recently to gain insight into, among others,
        DNNs’ generalization ability. However, it is by no means obvious how to estimate
        the mutual information (MI) between each hidden layer and the input/desired
        output to construct the IP. For instance, hidden layers with many neurons
        require MI estimators with robustness toward the high dimensionality associated
        with such layers. MI estimators should also be able to handle convolutional
        layers while at the same time being computationally tractable to scale to
        large networks. Existing IP methods have not been able to study truly deep
        convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose an IP analysis using the
        new matrix-based Rényi’s entropy coupled with tensor kernels, leveraging the
        power of kernel methods to represent properties of the probability distribution
        independently of the dimensionality of the data. Our results shed new light
        on previous studies concerning small-scale DNNs using a completely new approach.
        We provide a comprehensive IP analysis of large-scale CNNs, investigating
        the different training phases and providing new insights into the training
        dynamics of large-scale neural networks.

        to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a novel approach
        that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering assumption in SSL through
        extending a recently proposed differentiable clustering module. Leveraging
        annotated data to guide the cluster centroids results in a simple end-to-end
        trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that the proposed model improves
        the performance over the supervised-only baseline and show that our framework
        can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods to further boost their performance.

      abstract: A major barrier to applying deep segmentation models in the medical
        domain is their typical data-hungry nature, requiring experts to collect and
        label large amounts of data for training. As a reaction, prototypical few-shot
        segmentation (FSS) models have recently gained traction as data-efficient
        alternatives. Nevertheless, despite the recent progress of these models, they
        still have some essential shortcomings that must be addressed. In this work,

        the lack of a guiding mechanism to help locate edges and encourage spatial
        consistency in the segmentation maps, and (iii) the models’ inability to do

        power of these architectures, their recurrent nature complicates their understanding
        and poses challenges in the training procedures. Recently, new important families
        of recurrent architectures have emerged and their applicability in the context
        of load forecasting has not been investigated completely yet. In this paper
        we perform a comparative study on the problem of Short-Term Load Forecast,
        by using different classes of state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks.
        We test the reviewed models first on controlled synthetic tasks and then on
        different real datasets, covering important practical cases of study. We provide
        a general overview of the most important architectures and we define guidelines
        for configuring the recurrent networks to predict real-valued time series.

      abstract: We introduce kernel entropy component analysis (kernel ECA) as a new
        method for data transformation and dimensionality reduction. Kernel ECA reveals
        structure relating to the Renyi entropy of the input space data set, estimated
        via a kernel matrix using Parzen windowing. This is achieved by projections
        onto a subset of entropy preserving kernel principal component analysis (kernel
        PCA) axes. This subset does not need, in general, to correspond to the top
        eigenvalues of the kernel matrix, in contrast to the dimensionality reduction
        using kernel PCA. We show that kernel ECA may produce strikingly different
        transformed data sets compared to kernel PCA, with a distinct angle-based
        structure. A new spectral clustering algorithm utilizing this structure is
        developed with positive results. Furthermore, kernel ECA is shown to be an
        useful alternative for pattern denoising.

      abstract: 'Deep learning-based approaches for content-based image retrieval
        (CBIR) of computed tomography (CT) liver images is an active field of research,

      abstract: 'Mentoring is a key component of scientific achievements, contributing
        to overall measures of career success for mentees and mentors. A common success
        metric in the scientific enterprise is acquiring a large research group, which
        is believed to indicate excellent mentorship and high-quality research. However,
        large, competitive groups might also amplify dropout rates, which are high
        especially among early career researchers. Here, we collect longitudinal genealogical
        data on mentor-mentee relations and their publication, and study the effects
        of a mentor''s group on future academic survival and performance of their
        mentees. We find that mentees trained in large groups generally have better
        academic performance than mentees from small groups, if they continue working
        in academia after graduation. However, we also find two surprising results:
        Academic survival rate is significantly lower for (1) mentees from larger
        groups, and for (2) mentees with more productive mentors. These findings reveal
        that success of mentors has a negative effect on the academic survival rate

      abstract: Museums often suffer from so-called ‘hypercongestion’, wherein the
        number of visitors exceeds the capacity of the physical space of the museum.
        This can potentially be detrimental to the quality of visitors' experiences,
        through disturbance by the behavior and presence of other visitors. Although
        this situation can be mitigated by managing visitors' flow between spaces,
        a detailed analysis of visitor movement is required to realize fully and apply
        a proper solution to the problem. In this paper we analyze visitors' sequential
        movements, the spatial layout, and the relationship between them in a large-

        combination (Wang et al., 2017). We exploit a sample of 230,854 articles (1985

      abstract: The availability of the propulsion system is of primary importance
        to ensure safe and stable operations of marine crafts, both during transit
        and station keeping. Diminished propulsion efficiency could impair the ability
        of a vessel to maintain speed and course and possibly lead to a drifting craft.
        The waterjet’s propulsion efficiency is affected by several factors such as
        cavitation, erosion, vibration and noise emission. This paper addresses the
        design of a fault-tolerant thrust allocation algorithm able to maintain the
        seaworthiness of a twin-waterjet marine craft in the presence of a severe
        power loss in one of the waterjets. The proposed solution combines a load
        torque estimator with an optimization routine that accounts for the power
        limits when a waterjet is subject to a power loss. This prevents faults from
        quickly escalating into a complete failure of the waterjet due to excessive
        power demands. Two simulated case studies including zig-zag path following
        and sideways movements are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
        fault tolerant control thrust allocation strategy.

      abstract: Parametric roll resonance on ships is a nonlinear phenomenon where
        waves encountered at twice the natural roll frequency can bring the vessel
        dynamics into a bifurcation mode and lead to extreme values of roll. Recent
        years have seen several incidents with dramatic damage to container vessels.
        The roll oscillation, which is subharmonic with respect to the wave excitation,
        may be completely unexpected and a system for detection of the onset of such
        resonance could warn the navigators before roll angles reach serious levels.
        Timely warning could make remedial actions possible, such as change the ship's
        speed and course, to escape from the bifurcation condition. This paper proposes
        nonparametric methods to detect the onset of roll resonance and demonstrates
        their performance. Theoretical conditions for parametric resonance are revisited
        and are used to develop efficient methods to detect its onset …

      abstract: Parametric roll is a critical phenomenon for ships, whose onset may
        cause roll oscillations up to 40 , leading to very dangerous situations and
        possibly capsizing. Container ships have been shown to be particularly prone
        to parametric roll resonance when they are sailing in moderate to heavy head
        seas. A Matlab/Simulinkr parametric roll benchmark model for a large container
        ship has been implemented and validated against a wide set of experimental
        data. The model is a part of a Matlab/Simulink Toolbox (MSS, 2007). The benchmark
        implements a 3rd-order nonlinear model where the dynamics of roll is strongly
        coupled with the heave and pitch dynamics. The implemented model has shown
        good accuracy in predicting the container ship motions, both in the vertical
        plane and in the transversal one. Parametric roll has been reproduced for
        all the data sets in which it happened, and the model provides realistic results
        which are in good agreement with the model tank experiments.

        has skyrocketed in the last two decades and new terms have appeared. However,
        only very few bibliometric analyses have reviewed some of these terms (eco-innovation,
        environmental innovation, green innovation, and sustainable innovation), and
        they concluded that such terms are mostly interchangeable. These findings
        surprise in light of the different positions shown in the innovation for sustainability
        debate. Our bibliometric analysis tracks meanings and communities associated
        with these four terms and indicates some overlaps, especially between eco-innovation
        and environmental innovation. However, we found relevant differences of meanings
        and communities that reflect the different positions in the innovation for
        sustainability debate.

      abstract: Predictive analytics is becoming more mature and is gaining traction
        in smart manufacturing around the world. Over the past decade, predictive
        analytics has hence reached a plateau of productivity while techniques and
        tools became more robust and accessible. Small- and medium-sized enterprises
        have to seize these new opportunities in order to optimize and embed analytics
        in high-value business scenarios and improve their competitiveness. However,
        getting started with predictive modeling can seem like an insurmountable feat
        for SMEs, why inspiration and pointers to real-world applications can be valuable.
        In this paper, we first introduce current trends in predictive analytics followed
        by a mini survey showcasing interesting real-world use cases in SMEs. Finally,
        we present common algorithms and models, followed by two recent real-world
        applications in Danish SMEs.

        to extract technology-related topics and keywords within scientific literature,
        and identify corresponding technologies within patent applications. Specifically,
        we utilize transformer based language models, tailored for use with scientific
        text, to detect coherent topics over time and describe these by relevant keywords
        that are automatically extracted from a large text corpus. We identify these
        keywords using Named Entity Recognition, distinguishing between those describing
        methods, applications and other scientific terminology. We create a large
        amount of search queries based on combinations of method- and application-keywords,
        which we use to conduct semantic search and identify related patents. By doing
        so, we aim at contributing to the growing body of research on text-based technology
        mapping and forecasting that leverages latest advances in natural language
        processing and deep learning. We are able to map technologies identified in
        scientific literature to patent applications, thereby providing an empirical
        foundation for the study of science-technology linkages. We illustrate the
        workflow as well as results obtained by mapping publications within the field
        of neuroscience to related patent applications.

      abstract: The private sector is playing an increasingly important role in basic
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) R&D. This phenomenon, which is reflected in the
        perception of a brain drain of researchers from academia to industry, is raising
        concerns about a privatisation of AI research which could constrain its societal
        benefits. We contribute to the evidence base by quantifying transition flows
        between industry and academia and studying its drivers and potential consequences.
        We find a growing net flow of researchers from academia to industry, particularly
        from elite institutions into technology companies such as Google, Microsoft
        and Facebook. Our survival regression analysis reveals that researchers working
        in the field of deep learning as well as those with higher average impact
        are more likely to transition into industry. A difference-in-differences analysis
        of the effect of switching into industry on a researcher's influence proxied
        by citations indicates that an initial increase in impact declines as researchers
        spend more time in industry. This points at a privatisation of AI knowledge
        compared to a counterfactual where those high-impact researchers had remained
        in academia. Our findings highlight the importance of strengthening the public
        AI research sphere in order to ensure that the future of this powerful technology
        is not dominated by private interests.

      abstract: Patent data is an important source of knowledge for innovation research.
        While the technological similarity between pairs of patents is a key enabling
        indicator for patent analysis. Recently researchers have been using patent
        vector space models based on different NLP embeddings models to calculate
        technological similarity between pairs of patents to help better understand
        innovations, patent landscaping, technology mapping, and patent quality evaluation.
        To the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive survey that builds
        a big picture of embedding models' performance for calculating patent similarity
        indicators. Therefore, in this study, we provide an overview of the accuracy
        of these algorithms based on patent classification performance. In a detailed
        discussion, we report the performance of the top 3 algorithms at section,
        class, and subclass levels. The results based on the first claim of patents
        show that PatentSBERTa, Bert-for-patents, and TF-IDF Weighted Word Embeddings
        have the best accuracy for computing sentence embeddings at the subclass level.
        According to the first results, the performance of the models in different
        classes varies which shows researchers in patent analysis can utilize the
        results of this study for choosing the best proper model based on the specific
        section of patent data they used.

        neurons, the extracellular concentration of dopamine, and activation of dopamine
        receptors remains unresolved. In the present study, we develop a computational
        model of dopamine signaling that give insight into the relationship between
        the dynamics of release and occupancy of D1 and D2 receptors. The model is
        derived from first principles using experimental data. It has no free parameters
        and offers unbiased estimation of the boundaries of dopaminergic volume transmission.
        Bursts primarily increase occupancy of D1 receptors, whereas pauses translate
        into low occupancy of D1 and D2 receptors. Phasic firing patterns, composed
        of bursts and pauses, reduce the average D2 receptor occupancy and increase
        average D1 receptor occupancy …

      abstract: Many limb movements are composed of alternating flexions and extensions.
        However, the underlying spinal network mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here,
        we show that the intensity of synaptic excitation and inhibition in limb motoneurons
        varies in phase rather than out of phase during rhythmic scratchlike network
        activity in the turtle. Inhibition and excitation peak with the total neuron
        conductance during the depolarizing waves of scratch episodes. Furthermore,
        spike activity is driven by depolarizing synaptic transients rather than pacemaker
        properties. These findings show that balanced excitation and inhibition and
        irregular firing are fundamental motifs in certain spinal network functions.

      abstract: The rhythmic motor activity of the vibrissae that rodents use for
        the tactile localization of objects provides a model system for understanding
        patterned motor activity in mammals. The muscles that drive this whisking
        are only partially fixed relative to bony attachments and thus shift their
        position along with the movement. As a means to characterize the pattern of
        muscular dynamics during different patterns of whisking, we recorded electromyogram
        (EMG) activity from the muscles that propel individual follicles, as well
        as EMG activity from a muscle group that moves the mystacial pad. The dominant
        pattern of whisking in our behavioral paradigm, referred to as exploratory
        whisking, consisted of large amplitude sweeps in the frequency range of 5–15
        Hz. The frequency remained remarkably constant within a bout of whisking but
        changed values between bouts. The extrinsic musculature, which shifts the

      abstract: Recent work has shown that convolutional neural network classifiers
        overly rely on texture at the expense of shape cues. We make a similar but
        different distinction between shape and local image cues, on the one hand,
        and global image statistics, on the other. Our method, called Permuted Adaptive
        Instance Normalization (pAdaIN), reduces the representation of global statistics
        in the hidden layers of image classifiers. pAdaIN samples a random permutation
        p that rearranges the samples in a given batch. Adaptive Instance Normalization
        (AdaIN) is then applied between the activations of each (non-permuted) sample
        i and the corresponding activations of the sample p (i), thus swapping statistics
        between the samples of the batch. Since the global image statistics are distorted,
        this swapping procedure causes the network to rely on cues, such as shape
        or texture. By choosing the random permutation with probability p and the
        identity permutation otherwise, one can control the effect's strength. With
        the correct choice of p, fixed apriori for all experiments and selected without
        considering test data, our method consistently outperforms baselines in multiple
        settings. In image classification, our method improves on both CIFAR100 and
        ImageNet using multiple architectures. In the setting of robustness, our method
        improves on both ImageNet-C and Cifar-100-C for multiple architectures. In
        the setting of domain adaptation and domain generalization, our method achieves
        state of the art results on the transfer learning task from GTAV to Cityscapes
        and on the PACS benchmark.

      abstract: Neural fields have emerged as a new paradigm for representing signals,
        thanks to their ability to do it compactly while being easy to optimize. In
        most applications, however, neural fields are treated like a black box, which
        precludes many signal manipulation tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
        class of neural fields called basis-encoded polynomial neural fields (PNFs).
        The key advantage of a PNF is that it can represent a signal as a composition
        of a number of manipulable and interpretable components without losing the
        merits of neural fields representation. We develop a general theoretical framework
        to analyze and design PNFs. We use this framework to design Fourier PNFs,
        which match state-of-the-art performance in signal representation tasks that
        use neural fields. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that Fourier PNFs
        enable signal manipulation applications such as texture transfer and scale-space
        interpolation. Code is available at https://github. com/stevenygd/PNF.

        image is manipulated to match the textures and colors of a target image, and
        (ii) essence transfer, in which one edits the source image to include high-level
        semantic attributes from the target. Crucially, the semantic attributes that
        constitute the essence of an image may differ from image to image. Our blending
        operator combines the powerful StyleGAN generator and the semantic encoder

        resulting in a mechanism that guarantees both identity preservation and high-level
        feature transfer without relying on a facial recognition network. We present
        two variants of our method. The first is based on optimization, while the

      abstract: We wish to automatically predict the" speediness" of moving objects
        in videos-whether they move faster, at, or slower than their" natural" speed.
        The core component in our approach is SpeedNet--a novel deep network trained
        to detect if a video is playing at normal rate, or if it is sped up. SpeedNet
        is trained on a large corpus of natural videos in a self-supervised manner,
        without requiring any manual annotations. We show how this single, binary
        classification network can be used to detect arbitrary rates of speediness
        of objects. We demonstrate prediction results by SpeedNet on a wide range
        of videos containing complex natural motions, and examine the visual cues
        it utilizes for making those predictions. Importantly, we show that through
        predicting the speed of videos, the model learns a powerful and meaningful
        space-time representation that goes beyond simple motion cues. We demonstrate
        how those learned features can boost the performance of self supervised action
        recognition, and can be used for video retrieval. Furthermore, we also apply
        SpeedNet for generating time-varying, adaptive video speedups, which can allow
        viewers to watch videos faster, but with less of the jittery, unnatural motions
        typical to videos that are sped up uniformly.

      abstract: The ability to assess the robustness of image classifiers to a diverse
        set of manipulations is essential to their deployment in the real world. Recently,
        semantic manipulations of real images have been considered for this purpose,
        as they may not arise using standard adversarial settings. However, such semantic
        manipulations are often limited to style, color or attribute changes. While
        expressive, these manipulations do not consider the full capacity of a pretrained
        generator to affect adversarial image manipulations. In this work, we aim
        at leveraging the full capacity of a pretrained image generator to generate
        highly detailed, diverse and photorealistic image manipulations. Inspired
        by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method called Adversarial
        Pivotal Tuning (APT). APT first finds a pivot latent space input to a pretrained
        generator that best reconstructs an input image. It then adjusts the weights
        of the generator to create small, but semantic, manipulations which fool a
        pretrained classifier. Crucially, APT changes both the input and the weights
        of the pretrained generator, while preserving its expressive latent editing
        capability, thus allowing the use of its full capacity in creating semantic
        adversarial manipulations. We demonstrate that APT generates a variety of
        semantic image manipulations, which preserve the input image class, but which
        fool a variety of pretrained classifiers. We further demonstrate that classifiers
        trained to be robust to other robustness benchmarks, are not robust to our
        generated manipulations and propose an approach to improve the robustness
        towards our generated manipulations. Code available at …

      abstract: 'Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the
        generation of diverse and high-quality images. However, generated images often
        fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to
        ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train
        diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This comes with a downside, doing
        so limits their expressive power: (i) supervised datasets are generally small
        compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image
        models are trained, and so the quality and diversity of generated images are
        severely affected, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to
        free-form text, which limits the control over the generated images. In this
        work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on
        the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through
        discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier, which guides the generation.
        This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of a single input token
        of a text-to-image diffusion model, using the classifier, by steering generated
        images toward a given target class. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning
        methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining
        of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing
        that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than
        standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a
        low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to

      abstract: 'Complete movement arrest has recently been reported to be induced
        in rodents by optogenetic stimulation of a subpopulation within the pedunculopontine
        nucleus (PPN). This evoked arrest appears conspicuously similar to freezing
        behavior often seen as a fear response in prey animals but could also be akin
        to the freezing of gait, which is a symptom of Parkinson''s disease. This
        introduces two perspectives on the functional roles of this sub-region: A
        hub for orchestrating fear-related responses or an omnipotent halting mechanism
        devoid of emotional components. To better understand this phenomenon and its
        cognitive component, we engage the distinct electrical brain activity, the
        hippocampal theta rhythm. This rhythm has a well-described contextual association
        between various aspects of cognition and behavior. It is prominent during
        locomotor activity in rodents and immobile yet aroused states like behavioral
        freezing. We recorded the electrical activity in the hippocampus of rats while
        walking and being arrested by PPN stimulation. A clear obstruction of the
        ongoing theta activity was associated with the motor arrest. The timescale
        of movement arrest was less than 200 ms, similar to the obstruction of the
        theta rhythm. Since, anxiety, fear, and behavioral freezing are associated
        with hippocampal theta rhythm, which we did not see during PPN stimulation,
        we suggest the induced motor arrest occurs without an associated emotional
        component.'

        designed to target the dorsal column of the spinal cord. Here, we hypothesized
        that an arrangement of electrodes targeting the ensemble of dorsal roots involved
        in leg and trunk movements would result in superior efficacy, restoring more
        diverse motor activities after the most severe SCI. To test this hypothesis,
        we established a computational framework that informed the optimal arrangement
        of electrodes on a new paddle lead and guided its neurosurgical positioning.
        We also developed software supporting the rapid configuration of activity-specific
        stimulation programs that reproduced the natural activation of motor neurons
        underlying each activity. We tested these neurotechnologies in three …

      title: Activity-dependent spinal cord neuromodulation rapidly restores trunk
        and leg motor functions after complete paralysis
    4VxBgJMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC:
      abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces haemodynamic instability that threatens
        survival–, impairs neurological recovery,, increases the risk of cardiovascular
        disease,, and reduces quality of life,. Haemodynamic instability in this context
        is due to the interruption of supraspinal efferent commands to sympathetic
        circuits located in the spinal cord, which prevents the natural baroreflex
        from controlling these circuits to adjust peripheral vascular resistance.
        Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord has been shown to
        compensate for interrupted supraspinal commands to motor circuits below the
        injury, and restored walking after paralysis. Here, we leveraged these concepts
        to develop EES protocols that restored haemodynamic stability after SCI. We
        established a preclinical model that enabled us to dissect the topology and
        dynamics of the sympathetic circuits, and to understand how EES can engage
        these circuits …

        Here, we restored this communication with a digital bridge between the brain

        reliability has remained stable over one year, including during independent

        illness in communities. Quantification of the rates at which treatment is
        accessed is critical for health system planning and a prerequisite for disease
        burden estimates. In this study, national data on the proportion of children
        under five years old with fever who were taken for medical treatment were
        collected from all available countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia
        (n = 91). We used generalised additive mixed models to estimate 30-year trends
        in the treatment-seeking rates across the majority of countries in these regions

        for medical treatment increased steadily over the last 30 years, with the
        greatest increases occurring in areas where rates had originally been lowest,
        which includes Latin America and Caribbean, North Africa and the Middle East
        (51 and 50% increase, respectively), and Sub-Saharan Africa (23% increase).
        Overall, the aggregated and population-weighted estimate of children with

        major part of the responses first to contain, then to mitigate, the spread
        of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Common SDMs included limiting the size of
        gatherings, closing schools and/or workplaces, implementing work-from-home
        arrangements, or more stringent restrictions such as lockdowns. This systematic
        review summarized the evidence for the effectiveness of nine SDMs. Almost
        all of the studies included were observational in nature, which meant that

      abstract: As both mechanistic and geospatial malaria modeling methods become
        more integrated into malaria policy decisions, there is increasing demand
        for strategies that combine these two methods. This paper introduces a novel
        archetypes-based methodology for generating high-resolution intervention impact
        maps based on mechanistic model simulations. An example configuration of the
        framework is described and explored. First, dimensionality reduction and clustering
        techniques were applied to rasterized geospatial environmental and mosquito
        covariates to find archetypal malaria transmission patterns. Next, mechanistic
        models were run on a representative site from each archetype to assess intervention
        impact. Finally, these mechanistic results were reprojected onto each pixel
        to generate full maps of intervention impact. The example configuration used
        ERA5 and Malaria Atlas Project covariates, singular value decomposition, k-means
        clustering, and the Institute for Disease Modeling’s EMOD model to explore
        a range of three-year malaria interventions primarily focused on vector control
        and case management. Rainfall, temperature, and mosquito abundance layers
        were clustered into ten transmission archetypes with distinct properties.
        Example intervention impact curves and maps highlighted archetype-specific
        variation in efficacy of vector control interventions. A sensitivity analysis
        showed that the procedure for selecting representative sites to simulate worked
        well in all but one archetype. This paper introduces a novel methodology which
        combines the richness of spatiotemporal mapping with the rigor of mechanistic
        modeling to create a …

      abstract: Dengue is a systemic viral infection transmitted between humans by
        Aedes mosquitoes. For some patients, dengue is a life-threatening illness.
        There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial
        vector control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread.
        The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection
        and its public health burden are poorly known,. Here we undertake an exhaustive
        assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal
        modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then
        pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue
        cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of
        dengue in 2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics,

      abstract: The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) is an important measure
        of epidemic transmissibility that directly informs policy decisions and the
        optimisation of control measures. EpiEstim is a widely used opensource software
        tool that uses case incidence and the serial interval (SI, time between symptoms
        in a case and their infector) to estimate Rt in real-time. The incidence and
        the SI distribution must be provided at the same temporal resolution, which
        can limit the applicability of EpiEstim and other similar methods, e.g. for
        contexts where the time window of incidence reporting is longer than the mean
        SI. In the EpiEstim R package, we implement an expectation-maximisation algorithm
        to reconstruct daily incidence from temporally aggregated data, from which
        Rt can then be estimated. We assess the validity of our method using an extensive
        simulation study and apply it to COVID-19 and influenza data. For all datasets,
        the influence of intra-weekly variability in reported data was mitigated by
        using aggregated weekly data. Rt estimated on weekly sliding windows using
        incidence reconstructed from weekly data was strongly correlated with estimates
        from the original daily data. The simulation study revealed that Rt was well
        estimated in all scenarios and regardless of the temporal aggregation of the
        data. In the presence of weekend effects, Rt estimates from reconstructed
        data were more successful at recovering the true value of Rt than those obtained
        from reported daily data. These results show that this novel method allows
        Rt to be successfully recovered from aggregated data using a simple approach
        with very few data requirements. Additionally …

      abstract: Adult intestinal stem cells are located at the bottom of crypts of
        Lieberkühn, where they express markers such as LGR5, and fuel the constant
        replenishment of the intestinal epithelium. Although fetal LGR5-expressing
        cells can give rise to adult intestinal stem cells,, it remains unclear whether
        this population in the patterned epithelium represents unique intestinal stem-cell
        precursors. Here we show, using unbiased quantitative lineage-tracing approaches,
        biophysical modelling and intestinal transplantation, that all cells of the
        mouse intestinal epithelium—irrespective of their location and pattern of
        LGR5 expression in the fetal gut tube—contribute actively to the adult intestinal
        stem cell pool. Using 3D imaging, we find that during fetal development the
        villus undergoes gross remodelling and fission. This brings epithelial cells
        from the non-proliferative villus into the proliferative intervillus region,
        which enables them to …

      abstract: Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile
        spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks,
        including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin
        issues in astronauts is currently not well understood. To address this issue,
        we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository
        (OSDR) on spaceflown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biomedical
        profiles from fifty NASA astronauts, and confirmation via transcriptomic data
        from JAXA astronauts, the NASA Twins Study, and the first civilian commercial
        mission, Inspiration4. Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA
        damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation were determined to be involved
        with skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning
        model was utilized to determine key genes driving spaceflight response in
        the skin. These results can be used for determining potential countermeasures
        to mitigate spaceflight damage to the skin.

        pathophysiology is poorly understood due to the high complexity of affected
        neuronal circuits. To identify dysfunctional neuronal subtypes underlying

        analysis of >110,000 neuronal transcriptomes derived from temporal cortex
        samples of multiple temporal lobe epilepsy and non-epileptic subjects. We
        found that the largest transcriptomic changes occur in distinct neuronal subtypes
        from several families of principal neurons (L5-6_Fezf2 and L2-3_Cux2) and

      abstract: The interaction between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC)-bound epitopes is one of the most important processes in the
        adaptive human immune response. Several hypotheses on TCR triggering have
        been proposed. Many of them involve structural and dynamical adjustments in
        the TCR/peptide/MHC interface. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are a computational
        technique that is used to investigate structural dynamics at atomic resolution.
        Such simulations are used to improve understanding of signalling on a structural
        level. Here we review how MD simulations of the TCR/peptide/MHC complex have

      abstract: Most cell-surface receptors for cytokines and growth factors signal
        as dimers, but it is unclear whether remodeling receptor dimer topology is
        a viable strategy to "tune" signaling output. We utilized diabodies (DA) as
        surrogate ligands in a prototypical dimeric receptor-ligand system, the cytokine
        Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EpoR), to dimerize EpoR ectodomains
        in non-native architectures. Diabody-induced signaling amplitudes varied from
        full to minimal agonism, and structures of these DA/EpoR complexes differed
        in EpoR dimer orientation and proximity. Diabodies also elicited biased or
        differential activation of signaling pathways and gene expression profiles
        compared to EPO. Non-signaling diabodies inhibited proliferation of erythroid
        precursors from patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm due to a constitutively
        active JAK2V617F mutation. Thus, intracellular oncogenic mutations causing

      abstract: Public Transport Networks plays a central role in cities development.
        In big cities such system may be represented by a complex network and understand
        its properties is of great interest for managers and scholars. In this work,
        the urban public transport system of Sao Paulo is reinterpreted as a coupled
        (bus, subway and train) network, bypassing operational details and focusing
        on connectivity. Using a empirically generated graph, a statistical characterization
        is made by network metrics. Nearby bus stops and rail transport stations (subway
        and train) may or may not be considered as a single vertex in the network
        representation of the transport system, depending on how much an user is willing
        to walk to shift from one stop/station to another. This distance radius is
        then used to group nearby stops/stations as a single vertex in the network
        representation of the urban public transport system and then its properties
        are studied as a function of this radius. This radius is used as proxy of
        the user’s willingness to walk until the nearest point to access transportation.
        The variation of the measure ρ leads to changes in the perception of the topology
        of the public transport network as shown in this work. An interesting result
        was that the network is assortative. Another aspect investigated was the degree
        distribution of the network. It was not possible to distinguish between power-law
        or a log-normal distribution. An exploratory model is used to test the robustness
        of the network by randomly, deterministically and preferentially targeting
        the stops and service lines. According to the grouping radius, aka willingness,
        different fragmentation values were obtained under …

      abstract: The signature of early cancer dynamics on the spatial arrangement
        of tumour cells is poorly understood, and yet could encode information about
        how sub-clones grew within the expanding tumour. Novel methods of quantifying
        spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary
        dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose
        a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex
        spatial patterns of tumour cell population mixing. First, using a simple model
        of cell mixing we demonstrate how first passage time statistics can distinguish
        between different pattern structures. We then apply our method to simulated
        patterns of mutated and non-mutated tumour cell population mixing, generated
        using an agent-based model of expanding tumours, to explore how first passage
        times reflect mutant cell replicative advantage, time of emergence and strength
        of cell pushing. Finally, we explore applications to experimentally measured
        human colorectal cancer, and estimate parameters of early sub-clonal dynamics
        using our spatial computational model. We infer a wide range of sub-clonal
        dynamics, with mutant cell division rates varying between 1 and 4 times the
        rate of non-mutated cells across our sample set. Some mutated sub-clones emerged
        after as few as 100 non-mutant cell divisions, and others only after 50,000
        divisions. The majority were consistent with boundary driven growth or short-range
        cell pushing. By analysing multiple sub-sampled regions in a small number
        of samples, we explore how the distribution of inferred dynamics could inform
        about the initial mutational event …

      abstract: One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
        is that it disproportionately affects people from some specific ethnic and
        socio-economic minorities. In particular, since from the beginning of the
        pandemic it has been clear that people from Black and African American backgrounds
        seem to be hit especially hard by the virus, creating a substantial infection
        gap. The observed abnormal impact on these ethnic groups could probably be
        due to the co-occurrence of other known risk factors, including co-morbidity,
        poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation
        and response to cures, although those factors do not seem able to explain
        fully and in depth the excess incidence of infections and deaths among African
        Americans. Here, we introduce the concept of diffusion segregation, that is
        the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed

      abstract: Socioeconomic segregation has an important role in the emergence of
        large-scale inequalities in urban areas. Most of the available measures of
        spatial segregation depend on the scale and size of the system under study,
        or neglect large-scale spatial correlations, or rely on ad-hoc parameters,
        making it hard to compare different systems on equal grounds. We propose here
        a family of non-parametric measures for spatial distributions, based on the
        statistics of the trajectories of random walks on graphs associated to a spatial
        system. These quantities provide a consistent estimation of segregation in
        synthetic spatial patterns, and we use them to analyse the ethnic segregation
        of metropolitan areas in the US and the UK. We show that the spatial diversity
        of ethnic distributions, as measured through diffusion on graphs, allow us
        to compare the ethnic segregation of urban areas having different size, shape,

      abstract: Embedding a network in hyperbolic space can reveal interesting features
        for the network structure, especially in terms of self-similar characteristics.
        The hidden metric space, which can be thought of as the underlying structure
        of the network, is able to preserve some interesting features generally observed
        in real-world networks such as heterogeneity in the degree distribution, high
        clustering coefficient, and small-world effect. Moreover, the angular distribution
        of the nodes in the hyperbolic plane reveals a community structure of the
        embedded network. It is worth noting that, while a large body of literature
        compares well-known community detection algorithms, there is still no consensus
        on what defines an ideal community partition on a network. Moreover, heuristics
        for communities found on networks embedded in the hyperbolic space have been
        investigated here for the first time. We compare the partitions found on embedded
        networks to the partitions obtained before the embedding step, both for a
        synthetic network and for two real-world networks. The second part of this
        paper presents the application of our pipeline to a network of retweets in
        the context of the Italian elections. Our results uncover a community structure
        reflective of the political spectrum, encouraging further research on the
        application of community detection heuristics to graphs mapped onto hyperbolic
        planes.

      abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the first epidemic in human history
        in which digital contact tracing has been deployed at a global scale. Tracking
        and quarantining all the contacts of individuals who test positive for a virus
        can help slow down an epidemic, but the impact of contact tracing is severely
        limited by the generally low adoption of contact-tracing apps in the population.
        We derive here an analytical expression for the effectiveness of contact-tracing
        app installation strategies in a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model
        on a given contact graph. We propose a decentralized heuristic to improve
        the effectiveness of contact tracing under fixed adoption rates, which targets
        a set of individuals to install contact-tracing apps and can be easily implemented.
        Simulations on a large number of real-world contact networks confirm that
        this heuristic represents a feasible alternative to the current state of the
        art.

        making pertaining processes’ efficiencies. The availability of products through
        healthcare SCM is often a matter of life or death to the patient; therefore,

      abstract: Worldwide, buildings account for ca. 40% of the total energy consumption
        and ca. 20% of the total CO2 emissions. While most of the energy goes into
        primary building use, a significant amount of energy is wasted due to malfunctioning
        building system equipment and wrongly configured Building Management Systems
        (BMS). For example, wrongly configured setpoints or building equipment, or
        misplaced sensors and actuators, can contribute to deviations of the real
        energy consumption from the predicted one. Our paper is motivated by these
        posed challenges and aims at pinpointing the types of problems in the BMS
        components that can affect the energy efficiency of a building, as well as
        review the methods that can be utilized for their discovery and diagnosis.
        The goal of the paper is to highlight the challenges that lie in this problem
        domain, as well as provide a strategy how to counterfeit them.

      abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is essential to most biological
        processes. Abnormal interactions may have implications in a number of neurological
        syndromes. Given that the association and dissociation of protein molecules
        is crucial, computational tools capable of effectively identifying PPI are
        desirable. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect
        PPI based on pairwise similarity and using only the primary structure of the
        protein. The PPI based on Pairwise Similarity (PPI-PS) method consists of
        a representation of each protein sequence by a vector of pairwise similarities
        against large subsequences of amino acids created by a shifting window which
        passes over concatenated protein training sequences. Each coordinate of this
        vector is typically the E-value of the Smith-Waterman score. These vectors
        are then used to compute the kernel matrix which will be exploited in conjunction
        with support vector machines. To assess the ability of the proposed method
        to recognize the difference between "interacted" and "non-interacted" proteins
        pairs, we applied it on different datasets from the available yeast saccharomyces
        cerevisiae protein interaction. The proposed method achieved reasonable improvement
        over the existing state-of-the-art methods for PPI prediction. Pairwise similarity
        score provides a relevant measure of similarity between protein sequences.
        This similarity incorporates biological knowledge about proteins and it is
        extremely powerful when combined with support vector machine to predict PPI.

      abstract: Despite attempts to increase gender parity in politics, global efforts
        have struggled to ensure equal female representation. This is likely tied
        to implicit gender biases against women in authority. In this work, we present
        a comprehensive study of gender biases that appear in online political discussion.
        To this end, we collect 10 million comments on Reddit in conversations about
        male and female politicians, which enables an exhaustive study of automatic
        gender bias detection. We address not only misogynistic language, but also
        other manifestations of bias, like benevolent sexism in the form of seemingly
        positive sentiment and dominance attributed to female politicians, or differences
        in descriptor attribution. Finally, we conduct a multi-faceted study of gender
        bias towards politicians investigating both linguistic and extra-linguistic
        cues. We assess 5 different types of gender bias, evaluating coverage, combinatorial,
        nominal, sentimental and lexical biases extant in social media language and
        discourse. Overall, we find that, contrary to previous research, coverage
        and sentiment biases suggest equal public interest in female politicians.
        Rather than overt hostile or benevolent sexism, the results of the nominal
        and lexical analyses suggest this interest is not as professional or respectful
        as that expressed about male politicians. Female politicians are often named
        by their first names and are described in relation to their body, clothing,
        or family; this is a treatment that is not similarly extended to men. On the
        now banned far-right subreddits, this disparity is greatest, though differences
        in gender biases still appear in the right and left-leaning subreddits. We

        digital misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic and analyze how citizens
        spread and reject information about facemasks on Twitter in Denmark. Our study
        shows that the amount of misinformation is limited, but that false claims
        are not predominantly countered through fact-checking or dialogue. Instead,
        users who reject the misinformation often use irony and condescending comments
        to distance themselves from those who spread misinformation and whose concerns
        are thus not taken seriously. Our findings question citizens’ ability to effectively
        correct misinformation online and point to the importance of group affiliation
        and social status not only in spreading, but also in rejecting digital misinformation.

      abstract: ImplicationsAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health
        Organization warned that an infodemic jeopardized pandemic-quelling efforts
        and encouraged social media platforms to retaliate against the spread of online
        misinformation (WHO, 2020). Here, we understand misinformation as verifiably
        false claims presented as factually true, regardless of the disseminators’
        cognizance of the falsehood (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). By focusing on misinformation
        rather than disinformation—false information created for the strategic purpose
        of deceit (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017)—we explored users’ interactions with
        false claims regardless of the motivation behind their spread. We simply investigated
        whether the tweet text supported or countered a false claim. These false claims
        were drawn from the largest independent Danish fact-checking institution,
        TjekDet. We relied on the facemask debate, the misinformation theme identified
        via TjekDet that engaged most tweets. Additionally, we suspected this debate
        to be a fertile ground for misinformation due to the Danish authorities’ change
        of stance on facemasks partway through the pandemic (Krakov, 2020; Statsministeriet,
        2020b) and the often-misinterpreted inconclusive mask study (see Abbasi, 2020),
        leaving citizens to navigate through changing and conflicting statements regarding
        the efficacy of facemasks.Most studies of misinformation during the pandemic
        focus on the disseminators (Caldarelli et al., 2021; Cinelli et al., 2020;
        Gallotti et al., 2020), while few scholars have explored how citizens combat
        false information online (Abidin, 2020; Micallef et al., 2020; Pulido et al.,

        Verification system relies upon the system’s capability to learn discriminative

        based on the popular Very Deep VGG [1] CNNs, with key modifications to accommodate
        variable length spectrogram inputs, reduce the model disk space requirements
        and reduce the number of parameters, resulting in significant reduction in
        training times. We also propose a unified deep learning system for both Text-Independent
        Speaker Recognition and Speaker Verification, by training the proposed network

        Human emotions can be identified across different modalities, such as biosignal,
        speech, text, and mimics. This paper is focusing on time-continuous prediction
        of level of valence and psycho-physiological arousal. In that regard, we investigate,
        (a) the use of different feature embeddings obtained from neural networks
        pre-trained on different speech tasks (e.g., phone classification, speech
        emotion recognition) and self-supervised neural networks, (b) estimation of
        arousal and valence from physiological signals in an end-to-end manner and

      abstract: The majority of the recent works that address the interpretability
        of raw waveform based deep neural networks (DNNs) for audio processing focus
        on interpreting spectral and frequency response information, often limiting
        to visual and signal theoretic means of interpretation, solely for the first
        layer. This work proposes sonification, a method to interpret intermediate
        feature representations of sound event recognition (SER) 1D-convolutional
        neural networks (1D-CNNs) trained on raw waveforms by mapping these representations
        back into the discrete-time input signal domain, highlighting substructures
        in the input that maximally activate a feature map as intelligible acoustic
        events. Sonification is used to compare supervised and contrastive self-supervised
        feature representations, observing how the latter learn more acoustically
        discernible representations, especially in the deeper layers. A metric to
        quantify acoustic similarity between the interpretations and their corresponding
        inputs is proposed, and a layer-by-layer analysis of the trained feature representations
        using this metric supports the observations made.

        event types. We also release GISE-51-Mixtures, a dataset of 5-second soundscapes
        with hard-labelled event boundaries synthesized from GISE-51 isolated sound

      abstract: Conventionally, speech emotion recognition has been approached by
        utterance or turn-level modelling of input signals, either through extracting
        hand-crafted low-level descriptors, bag-of-audio-words features or by feeding
        long-duration signals directly to deep neural networks (DNNs). While this
        approach has been successful, there is a growing interest in modelling speech
        emotion information at the short segment level, at around 250ms-500ms (e.g.
        the 2021-22 MuSe Challenges). This paper investigates both hand-crafted feature-based
        and end-to-end raw waveform DNN approaches for modelling speech emotion information
        in such short segments. Through experimental studies on IEMOCAP corpus, we

      abstract: Deep audio classification, traditionally cast as training a deep neural
        network on top of mel-filterbanks in a supervised fashion, has recently benefited
        from two independent lines of work. The first one explores "learnable frontends",
        i.e., neural modules that produce a learnable time-frequency representation,
        to overcome limitations of fixed features. The second one uses self-supervised
        learning to leverage unprecedented scales of pre-training data. In this work,
        we study the feasibility of combining both approaches, i.e., pre-training
        learnable frontend jointly with the main architecture for downstream classification.
        First, we show that pretraining two previously proposed frontends (SincNet
        and LEAF) on Audioset drastically improves linear-probe performance over fixed
        mel-filterbanks, suggesting that learnable time-frequency representations
        can benefit self-supervised pre-training even more than supervised training.
        Surprisingly, randomly initialized learnable filterbanks outperform mel-scaled
        initialization in the self-supervised setting, a counter-intuitive result
        that questions the appropriateness of strong priors when designing learnable
        filters. Through exploratory analysis of the learned frontend components,
        we uncover crucial differences in properties of these frontends when used
        in a supervised and self-supervised setting, especially the affinity of self-supervised
        filters to diverge significantly from the mel-scale to model a broader range
        of frequencies.

      abstract: 'Several recent works have adapted Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) for
        learning general-purpose audio representations. However, they do not address
        two key aspects of modelling multi-domain audio data: (i) real-world audio
        tasks consist of a combination of local+global contexts, and (ii) real-world
        audio signals are complex compositions of several acoustic elements with different
        time-frequency characteristics. To address these concerns, this work proposes
        a Multi-Window Masked Autoencoder (MW-MAE) fitted with a novel Multi-Window
        Multi-Head Attention module that can capture information at multiple local
        and global contexts in every decoder transformer block through attention heads
        of several distinct local and global windows. Empirical results on ten downstream
        audio tasks show that MW-MAEs consistently outperform standard MAEs in overall
        performance and learn better general-purpose audio representations, as well
        as demonstrate considerably better scaling characteristics. Exploratory analyses
        of the learned representations reveals that MW-MAE encoders learn attention
        heads with more distinct entropies compared to those learned by MAEs, while
        attention heads across the different transformer blocks in MW-MAE decoders
        learn correlated feature representations, enabling each block to independently
        capture local and global information, leading to a decoupled feature hierarchy.

        learning techniques, such as Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Machines,
        and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), are taken for analysis. The main target
        of this paper is to explore the significance of deep learning techniques for
        the prediction of ubiquitination sites in protein sequences. Furthermore,
        the results obtained show that the newly proposed model provides significant
        accuracy. Satisfactory experimental results show the efficiency of proposed
        method for the prediction of ubiquitination sites in protein sequences. Further,
        it has been recommended that this method can be used to sort out real time
        problems in concerned domain.

      abstract: Optimization on manifolds is a class of methods for optimization of
        an objective function, subject to constraints which are smooth, in the sense
        that the set of points which satisfy the constraints admits the structure
        of a differentiable manifold. While many optimization problems are of the
        described form, technicalities of differential geometry and the laborious
        calculation of derivatives pose a significant barrier for experimenting with
        these methods. We introduce Pymanopt (available at pymanopt. github. io),
        a toolbox for optimization on manifolds, implemented in Python, that—similarly
        to the Manopt 1 Matlab toolbox—implements several manifold geometries and
        optimization algorithms. Moreover, we lower the barriers to users further
        by using automated differentiation 2 for calculating derivative information,
        saving users time and saving them from potential calculation and implementation
        errors.

      abstract: Simulated DAG models may exhibit properties that, perhaps inadvertently,
        render their structure identifiable and unexpectedly affect structure learning
        algorithms. Here, we show that marginal variance tends to increase along the
        causal order for generically sampled additive noise models. We introduce varsortability
        as a measure of the agreement between the order of increasing marginal variance
        and the causal order. For commonly sampled graphs and model parameters, we
        show that the remarkable performance of some continuous structure learning
        algorithms can be explained by high varsortability and matched by a simple
        baseline method. Yet, this performance may not transfer to real-world data
        where varsortability may be moderate or dependent on the choice of measurement
        scales. On standardized data, the same algorithms fail to identify the ground-truth
        DAG or its Markov equivalence class. While standardization removes the pattern
        in marginal variance, we show that data generating processes that incur high
        varsortability also leave a distinct covariance pattern that may be exploited
        even after standardization. Our findings challenge the significance of generic
        benchmarks with independently drawn parameters. The code is available at https://github.

      abstract: Additive Noise Models (ANM) encode a popular functional assumption
        that enables learning causal structure from observational data. Due to a lack
        of real-world data meeting the assumptions, synthetic ANM data are often used
        to evaluate causal discovery algorithms. Reisach et al. (2021) show that,
        for common simulation parameters, a variable ordering by increasing variance
        is closely aligned with a causal order and introduce var-sortability to quantify
        the alignment. Here, we show that not only variance, but also the fraction
        of a variable's variance explained by all others, as captured by the coefficient
        of determination , tends to increase along the causal order. Simple baseline
        algorithms can use -sortability to match the performance of established methods.
        Since -sortability is invariant under data rescaling, these algorithms perform
        equally well on standardized or rescaled data, addressing a key limitation
        of algorithms exploiting var-sortability. We characterize and empirically
        assess -sortability for different simulation parameters. We show that all
        simulation parameters can affect -sortability and must be chosen deliberately
        to control the difficulty of the causal discovery task and the real-world
        plausibility of the simulated data. We provide an implementation of the sortability
        measures and sortability-based algorithms in our library CausalDisco (https://github.com/CausalDisco/CausalDisco).

        versus models in which the `irrelevant'' or unobservable variables have been
        marginalised out; (b) micro-level models versus macro-level models in which
        the macro-variables are aggregate features of the micro-variables; (c) dynamical
        time series models versus models of their stationary behaviour. Our analysis
        stresses the importance of well specified interventions in the causal modelling
        process and sheds light on the interpretation of cyclic SEMs.'

      abstract: 'In mass cytometry marker interference called spillover, can cause
        markers to have higher abundances than their true abundances. Chevrier and
        Crowell et al. 2018 introduced an experimental and computational procedure
        to estimate spillover and compensate for it in downstream analyses. Their
        R package CATALYST implements this in two steps: estimate spillover and remove
        spillover from data. We propose a method that combines estimation and correction
        in one step, in order to quantify uncertainty and improve data efficiency.
        Building on a hierarchical causal model that represents the spillover from
        one marker to another, we extend the usual negative binomial model by modifying
        the link function using information from the spillover matrix. Our simulations
        show that an explicit causal model has two advantages: We control false positive
        errors even in noisy settings and improve statistical power when the causal
        model is correctly specified. We will present our new R package spillR and
        vignettes for reproducibility.'

        which causal statements are warranted and which ones are not supported by
        empirical evidence. We argue that the distinction between encoding and decoding

      abstract: Copyright is territorial, but the same cannot be said of the internet,
        whose borderless nature has changed the way we consume copyright-protected
        material. Nevertheless, territorial segmentation of online content remains
        a reality in the 28 member states of the European Union. Licensing and access
        practices do not reflect this digital reality, in which end-users demand ubiquitous
        access to content. For this reason, the territorial nature of copyright and
        traditional business models based on national exploitation prevent the completion
        of the Digital Single Market. Sebastian Felix Schwemer provides a unique analysis
        of the dynamic licensing and access arrangements for audiovisual works and
        music and shows how they are being addressed by sector regulation and competition
        law in the Digital Single Market. His analysis, which includes case law of
        the Court of Justice, the Commission's competition proceedings, and various
        legislative tools, reveals the overlapping nature of legislative and non-legislative
        regulatory solutions.

      abstract: While Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being applied in an increasing
        number of contexts, including law, it remains a difficult task to leverage
        NLP for the purpose of real-life support of legal decision-making. This is
        because 1) legal-decision making must be made in a way that is sensitive not
        only to legislation but also to evolving case practice (prior decision-making
        that functions as precedent), 2) legal-decision making is sensitive to open-ended
        legislative language and shifting factual contexts, 3) traditional methods
        of NLP are capable of processing long texts, but they are suboptimal compared
        to novel methods, ie, transformer-based models, eg, BERT [1], etc. 4) however
        the transformer-based models are limited by maximum input lengths, which makes
        it difficult to apply in real-life scenarios, where legal documents exceed
        the maximum input length. In this paper, we show how we tackle the problem
        of providing NLP-based intelligence support to legal decision-makers in a
        real-world setting using transformer-based NLP.

      abstract: Article 17 of the Directive on copyright and related rights in the
        Digital Single Market (the DSM Directive) has strengthened the protection
        of copyright holders. Moving forward, online content-sharing providers will
        be responsible for copyright infringement unless the use of works on their
        platforms is authorized or if they have made ‘best efforts’ to obtain an authorization
        and prevent the availability of unlicensed works. At the same time, the Directive
        has made it clear that users of protected works shall be able to rely on the
        existing limitations and exceptions regarding quotation, criticism and review
        and caricature, parody or pastiche. The Directive even casts these limitations
        and exceptions as user rights. This paper points out that copyright’s limitations
        and exceptions have traditionally constituted a corner stone in the internal
        balancing of the interests of users against rights holders and with a clear
        view of safeguarding the interests of free expression and information protected
        by the Charter. Given the overall purpose of the DSM Directive in strengthening
        the position of rights holders, there is a dire risk that the benefits of
        the limitations and exceptions evaporate in the attempts of platform operators
        to escape liability by use of algorithmic enforcement. The article uses the
        recent decisions of the CJEU in Pelham, Funke Medien and Spiegel Online to
        draw attention to the central importance of the limitations and exception
        as the primary channel for fundamental rights analyses in copyright. It is
        finally pointed out how the DSM Directive–despite of its on-the-paper recognition
        of users’ rights–is most likely going to lead to a devaluation of those same
        rights.

      abstract: In this paper we examine how human-machine interaction in the legal
        sector is suggested to be regulated in the EU’s recently proposed Artificial
        Intelligence Act. First, we provide a brief background and overview of the
        proposal. Then we turn towards the assessment of high-risk AI systems for
        the legal tasks as well as the obligations for such AI systems in terms of
        human-machine interaction. We argue that whereas the proposed definition of
        AI system is broad, the concrete high-risk area of ‘administration of justice
        and democratic processes’, despite coming with considerable legal uncertainty,
        is narrow and unlikely to extent into many uses of legal AI and IA systems.
        Nonetheless, these regulatory developments may be of great relevance for current
        and future legal AI and IA systems.

        related to the soccer ball change of state, and (3) dense video captioning,
        focusing on describing the broadcast with natural language and anchored timestamps.
        The second theme, field understanding, relates to the single task of (4) camera
        calibration, focusing on retrieving the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters
        from images. The third and last theme, player understanding, is composed of
        three low-level tasks related to extracting information about the players:

        views, (6) multiple object tracking, focusing on tracking players and the
        ball through unedited video streams, and (7) jersey number recognition, focusing

        connected convolutions (BCDU-Net), for medical image segmentation, in which
        we take full advantages of U-Net, bi-directional ConvLSTM (BConvLSTM) and
        the mechanism of dense convolutions. Instead of a simple concatenation in
        the skip connection of U-Net, we employ BConvLSTM to combine the feature maps
        extracted from the corresponding encoding path and the previous decoding up-convolutional
        layer in a non-linear way. To strengthen feature propagation and encourage
        feature reuse, we use densely connected convolutions in the last convolutional
        layer of the encoding path. Finally, we can accelerate the convergence speed
        of the proposed network by employing batch normalization (BN). The proposed
        model is evaluated on three datasets of: retinal blood vessel segmentation,
        skin lesion segmentation, and lung nodule segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art

      abstract: 'Since the introduction of the Vision Transformer (ViT), researchers
        have sought to make ViTs more efficient by removing redundant information
        in the processed tokens. While different methods have been explored to achieve
        this goal, we still lack understanding of the resulting reduction patterns
        and how those patterns differ across token reduction methods and datasets.
        To close this gap, we set out to understand the reduction patterns of 10 different
        token reduction methods using four image classification datasets. By systematically
        comparing these methods on the different classification tasks, we find that
        the Top-K pruning method is a surprisingly strong baseline. Through in-depth
        analysis of the different methods, we determine that: the reduction patterns
        are generally not consistent when varying the capacity of the backbone model,
        the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods significantly differ from
        fixed radial patterns, and the reduction patterns of pruning-based methods
        are correlated across classification datasets. Finally we report that the
        similarity of reduction patterns is a moderate-to-strong proxy for model performance.

        Deployments of real-world object detection systems often experience a degradation

        In this study, two types of weather-aware latent conditioning methods are
        investigated. The proposed method aims to guide two object detectors, (YOLOv5
        and Deformable DETR) to become weather-aware. This is achieved by leveraging
        an auxiliary branch that predicts weather-related information while conditioning
        intermediate layers of the object detector. While the conditioning methods
        proposed do not directly improve the accuracy of baseline detectors, it can
        be observed that conditioned networks manage to extract a weather-related
        signal from the thermal images, thus resulting in a decreased miss rate at
        the cost of increased false positives. The extracted signal appears noisy
        and is thus challenging to regress accurately. This is most likely a result
        of the qualitative nature of the thermal sensor; thus, further work is needed
        to identify an ideal method for optimizing the conditioning branch, as well
        as to further improve the accuracy of the system.'

      abstract: A common way to model multiclass classification problems is to design
        a set of binary classifiers and to combine them. Error-correcting output codes
        (ECOC) represent a successful framework to deal with these type of problems.
        Recent works in the ECOC framework showed significant performance improvements
        by means of new problem-dependent designs based on the ternary ECOC framework.
        The ternary framework contains a larger set of binary problems because of
        the use of a ldquodo not carerdquo symbol that allows us to ignore some classes
        by a given classifier. However, there are no proper studies that analyze the
        effect of the new symbol at the decoding step. In this paper, we present a
        taxonomy that embeds all binary and ternary ECOC decoding strategies into
        four groups. We show that the zero symbol introduces two kinds of biases that
        require redefinition of the decoding design. A new type of …

      abstract: Facial expressions are an important way through which humans interact
        socially. Building a system capable of automatically recognizing facial expressions
        from images and video has been an intense field of study in recent years.
        Interpreting such expressions remains challenging and much research is needed
        about the way they relate to human affect. This paper presents a general overview
        of automatic RGB, 3D, thermal and multimodal facial expression analysis. We
        define a new taxonomy for the field, encompassing all steps from face detection
        to facial expression recognition, and describe and classify the state of the
        art methods accordingly. We also present the important datasets and the bench-marking
        of most influential methods. We conclude with a general discussion about trends,
        important questions and future lines of research.

      abstract: We propose a novel way to improve the generalisation capacity of deep
        learning models by reducing high correlations between neurons. For this, we
        present two regularisation terms computed from the weights of a minimum spanning
        tree of the clique whose vertices are the neurons of a given network (or a
        sample of those), where weights on edges are correlation dissimilarities.
        We provide an extensive set of experiments to validate the effectiveness of
        our terms, showing that they outperform popular ones. Also, we demonstrate
        that naive minimisation of all correlations between neurons obtains lower
        accuracies than our regularisation terms, suggesting that redundancies play
        a significant role in artificial neural networks, as evidenced by some studies
        in neuroscience for real networks. We include a proof of differentiability
        of our regularisers, thus developing the first effective topological persistence-based
        regularisation terms that consider the whole set of neurons and that can be
        applied to a feedforward architecture in any deep learning task such as classification,
        data generation, or regression.

      abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) are one of the most prominent deep
        generative models for learning the underlying statistical distribution of
        high-dimensional data. However, training VAEs suffers from a severe issue
        called posterior collapse; that is, the learned posterior distribution collapses
        to the assumed/pre-selected prior distribution. This issue limits the capacity
        of the learned posterior distribution to convey data information. Previous
        work has proposed a heuristic training scheme to mitigate this issue, in which
        the core idea is to train the encoder and the decoder in an alternating fashion.
        However, there is still no theoretical interpretation of this scheme, and
        this paper, for the first time, fills in this gap by inspecting the previous
        scheme under the lens of the expectation maximization (EM) framework. Under
        this framework, we propose a novel EM-type training algorithm that gives a

      abstract: The Gaussian process state-space model (GPSSM) has attracted extensive
        attention for modeling complex nonlinear dynamical systems. However, the existing
        GPSSM employs separate Gaussian processes (GPs) for each latent state dimension,
        leading to escalating computational complexity and parameter proliferation,
        thus posing challenges for modeling dynamical systems with high-dimensional
        latent states. To surmount this obstacle, we propose to integrate the efficient
        transformed Gaussian process (ETGP) into the GPSSM, which involves pushing
        a shared GP through multiple normalizing flows to efficiently model the transition
        function in high-dimensional latent state space. Additionally, we develop
        a corresponding variational inference algorithm that surpasses existing methods
        in terms of parameter count and computational complexity. Experimental results
        on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of
        the proposed method, while also demonstrating its ability to achieve similar
        inference performance compared to existing methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/zhidilin/gpssmProj}.

        with limited rate. This paper considers problem of efficient downlink communication
        of multi-spectral satellite images for Earth observation using change detection.
        The proposed method for image processing consists of the joint design of cloud
        removal and change encoding, which can be seen as an instance of semantic
        communication, as it encodes important information, such as changed multi-spectral
        pixels (MPs), while aiming to minimize energy consumption. It comprises a
        three-stage end-to-end scoring mechanism that determines the importance of
        each MP before deciding its transmission. Specifically, the sensing image
        is (1) standardized, (2) passed through a high-performance cloud filtering
        via the Cloud-Net model, and (3) passed to the proposed scoring algorithm
        that uses Change-Net to identify MPs that have a high likelihood of being
        changed, compress them and forward the result to the ground station. The experimental
        results indicate that the proposed framework is effective in optimizing energy
        usage while preserving high-quality data transmission in satellite-based Earth
        observation applications.

        communication latency. To solve this problem, we address non-orthogonal multiple
        access (NOMA) assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to accommodate
        more devices and tailor their channels favorably to the FL performance. For
        the FL with IRS-NOMA, we minimize the total latency by reducing the latency
        per training round dominated by local computation and uplink communication
        through optimization of IRS-NOMA strategies and improving the training efficiency
        under irregular local data through active device selection. We then …

      abstract: Federated learning (FL) rests on the notion of training a global model
        in a decentralized manner. Under this setting, mobile devices perform computations
        on their local data before uploading the required updates to improve the global
        model. However, when the participating clients implement an uncoordinated
        computation strategy, the difficulty is to handle the communication efficiency
        (i.e., the number of communications per iteration) while exchanging the model
        parameters during aggregation. Therefore, a key challenge in FL is how users
        participate to build a high-quality global model with communication efficiency.
        We tackle this issue by formulating a utility maximization problem, and propose
        a novel crowdsourcing framework to leverage FL that considers the communication
        efficiency during parameters exchange. First, we show an incentive-based interaction
        between the crowdsourcing platform and the …

        multiplexing scenario of two distinct 5G services, namely Ultra-Reliable Low
        Latency Communications (URLLC) and enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB). While
        eMBB services focus on high data rates, URLLC is very strict in terms of latency
        and reliability. In view of this, the resource slicing problem is formulated
        as an optimization problem that aims at maximizing the eMBB data rate subject
        to a URLLC reliability constraint, while considering the variance of the eMBB
        data rate to reduce the impact of immediately scheduled URLLC traffic on the
        eMBB reliability. To solve the formulated problem, an optimization-aided Deep

        solution for enabling IoT-based smart applications. In this article, we present
        the primary design aspects for enabling federated learning at the network
        edge. We model the incentive- based interaction between a global server and

        the participation of the devices in the federated learning process. We present
        several open research challenges with their possible solutions. Finally, we

        coverage. At the same time, we have observed the exponential growth in Internet
        of Things (IoTs) devices and applications. However, as IoT devices have limited
        computation capacity and battery lifetime, it is challenging to process data
        locally on the devices. To this end, in this letter, a UAV-aided mobile edge

        at the IoT devices and the UAVs during task execution is studied by optimizing

      abstract: We treat the problem of client selection in a Federated Learning (FL)
        setup, where the learning objective and the local incentives of the participants
        are used to formulate a goal-oriented communication problem. Specifically,
        we incorporate the risk-averse nature of participants and obtain a communication-efficient
        on-device performance, while relying on feedback from the Parameter Server
        (\texttt{PS}). A client has to decide its transmission plan on when not to
        participate in FL. This is based on its intrinsic incentive, which is the
        value of the trained global model upon participation by this client. Poor
        updates not only plunge the performance of the global model with added communication
        cost but also propagate the loss in performance on other participating devices.
        We cast the relevance of local updates as \emph{semantic information} for
        developing local transmission strategies, i.e., making a decision on when
        to ``not transmit". The devices use feedback about the state of the PS and
        evaluate their contributions in training the learning model in each aggregation
        period, which eventually lowers the number of occupied connections. Simulation
        results validate the efficacy of our proposed approach, with up to  gain in
        communication links utilization as compared with the baselines.

        for neural network-based finite set model predictive control (NNFS-MPC) applied
        to two-level grid-connected converters. The neural network emulates the classical
        FS-MPC and is trained offline to expedite the FS-MPC process by eliminating
        the need for online optimization. Conventionally, the label dataset for training
        the imitation neural network controller consists of one-hot encoded indices
        of the selected voltage vectors, turning the neural network training problem
        into a multi-categorical task. However, as demonstrated in this paper, such

        The rapid and widespread deployment of SiC devices raises long-term reliability
        concerns, particularly for mission and safety critical systems due to limited

      abstract: This letter proposes a novel health indicator for aluminum electrolytic
        capacitors (AECs) based on strain sensing in a non-intrusive manner. The indicator
        leverages the mechanism that the internal pressure of AECs gradually increases
        with the electrochemical reaction caused by degradation, thereby, with a change
        in strain. The results reveal the proposed health indicator is highly sensitive
        to capacitor degradation and meanwhile highly resistant to interferences.
        Furthermore, an End-of-Life criterion for the AECs is proposed in this indicator,
        which is corresponding to the moment of open vent. The applicability of this
        indicator is verified for constant conditions, dynamic operating conditions,
        and overvoltage conditions. In addition, the effect of temperature is analyzed.
        The proposed health indicator can be used to determine the time-to-failure
        of testing samples in accelerated life testing and condition monitoring of
        AECs.

        to determine the EOL of IGBTs in power cycling test is certain percentage
        of increase of the on-state voltage. Nevertheless, it suffers from significant
        inconsistency among testing samples in the EOL-based cycle-to-failure with
        respect to its actual cycle-to-failure considering the thermal limit, that
        is, the cycle-to-failure margin. The proposed EOL criterion is based on the

        the antenna characteristics in an array, and therefore, degrades the system
        performance of the MIMO system and causes the spectral regrowth. Although
        the system performance can be partially improved by calibrating out the mutual
        coupling in the digital domain, it is more effective to use decoupling techniques
        (from the antenna point) to overcome the mutual coupling effects. Some popular

        This method is based on studying the transmission phase of each element in
        the holistic framework of a transmitarray, where all oblique incidences to
        each element are included. As a result, the actual transmission phase of every

        (5G) mobile applications. In order to achieve a broad three-dimensional scanning
        coverage of the space with high-gain beams, three identical subarrays of patch
        antennas have been compactly arranged along the edge region of the mobile
        phone printed circuit board (PCB) to form the antenna package. By switching
        the feeding to one of the subarrays, the desired direction of coverage can
        be achieved. The proposed design has >10-dB gain in the upper spherical space,
        good directivity, and efficiency, which is suitable for 5G mobile communications.
        In addition, the impact of the user's hand on the antenna performance has
        been investigated.

      abstract: A wideband neutralization line is proposed to reduce the mutual coupling
        of a compact ultrawideband (UWB) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna.
        With the introduced decoupling method, the designed UWB MIMO antenna covers
        the band of 3.1-5 GHz with an isolation of higher than 22 dB. The proposed
        wideband neutralization line is not necessarily placed in the clearance area
        between two MIMO elements and can be put above the copper ground. A small
        clearance (antenna area) of 35 ×16 mm 2  is achieved. The designed UWB MIMO
        antenna is fabricated. Sparameters, radiation patterns, total efficiency,
        and realized gain of the prototype are measured and compared to the simulations.

      abstract: A closely-packed ultrawideband (UWB) multiple- input multiple-output
        (MIMO)/diversity antenna (of two elements) with a size of 25 mm by 40 mm is
        proposed for USB dongle applications. Wideband isolation can be achieved through
        the different patterns and polarizations of the two antenna elements. Moreover,
        the slot that is formed between the monopole and the ground plane of the half
        slot antenna is conveniently used to further enhance the isolation at the
        lower frequencies and to provide an additional resonance at one antenna element
        in order to increase its bandwidth. The underlying mechanisms of the antenna's
        wide impedance bandwidth and low mutual coupling are analyzed in detail. Based
        on the measurement results, the proposed antenna can cover the lower UWB band
        of 3.1-5.15 GHz, and within the required band, the isolation exceeds 26 dB.

      abstract: A dual-polarized wideband low sidelobe slot array antenna for wireless
        communication systems in the V-band is proposed in this work. Taylor distribution
        is applied with each radiating slot as a tapering unit in both polarizations.
        A compact 2 × 2 elements subarray is designed to achieve stable amplitude
        and phase distribution among elements with two sets of integrated compact
        wideband unequal power dividers for the E- and H-planes inside the subarray.
        Then, two layers of orthogonally polarized feeding networks with unequal E-plane
        T-junction power dividers are used to connect the subarrays to two standard
        waveguides WR-15 as input ports. The prototype of 8 × 8 elements is fabricated
        and measured in an anechoic chamber. The maximum measured gain is 25.3 dBi

      abstract: This brief provides a mutual coupling suppression network for antenna
        arrays with high frequency selectivity. The proposed network is composed of
        three-order (denoting three decoupling bridges established by transmission
        lines) decoupling networks and unequal power dividers consisting of complementary
        split-ring resonators featuring bandpass and harmonic suppression responses.
        All the decoupling structures are highly integrated. A design example of a
        2×4 patch antenna array, working at 4.9 GHz and integrated with the proposed
        decoupling network, is constructed and fabricated. Simulated and measured
        results indicate that the antenna array is well-decoupled involving the suppression
        of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal coupling paths. The measured common
        bandwidth of impedance matching (|Sii| <.10 dB) and isolation (> 25 dB) is
        from 4.8 to 5.1 GHz. A small insertion loss of 0.35 dB is introduced …

      abstract: Anisotropy reveals interesting details of the subsurface structure
        of a material. We aim at noninvasive assessment of material anisotropy using
        as few measurements as possible. To this end, we evaluate different methods
        for detecting anisotropy when observing (1) several sample rotations, (2)
        two perpendicular planes of incidence, and (3) just one observation. We estimate
        anisotropy by fitting ellipses to diffuse reflectance isocontours, and we
        assess the robustness of this method as we reduce the number of observations.
        In addition, to support the validity of our ellipse fitting method, we propose
        a machine learning model for estimating material anisotropy.

      abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) incurs high latency and high sensitivity
        to connectivity failures. This can be improved by maximizing the ML processing
        on the local device. However, since these low-power devices typically have
        limited resources, the early-exit mechanism has been used to hierarchically
        split a neural network in parts over multiple devices, trading off computation
        with communication costs. But, the intermediate activations can be significantly
        large at the split point. In this paper, we present a novel entropy-based
        technique that learns to intelligently compress activations during training
        and efficiently encodes them during inference. We show that in an early-exit
        configuration, entropy regularization with Huffman coding can save up to 54%
        in communication cost, while keeping the classification accuracy of MobileNetV2
        on CIFAR-10 above 85%.

      abstract: While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in
        the medical field, the causes of differences in prediction performance are
        often unknown. This lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the
        efficacy of bias mitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset
        balancing still often performs best in reducing performance gaps but is unable
        to resolve all performance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes
        of gender bias in machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis. In particular,
        we explore the hypothesis that breast tissue leads to underexposure of the
        lungs and causes lower model performance. Methodologically, we propose a new
        sampling method which addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings
        per patient in two widely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing
        the impact of label errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences
        across diseases, datasets, and gender representations in the training set
        shows that dataset imbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences.
        Moreover, relative group performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating
        important dataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance.
        Finally, we investigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by
        cropping out the breasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve
        the observed performance gaps. In conclusion, our results indicate that dataset-specific
        factors, not fundamental physiological differences, are the main drivers of
        male--female performance gaps in chest X-ray analyses on widely used NIH and
        CheXpert Dataset.

      abstract: Learning probabilistic models that can estimate the density of a given
        set of samples, and generate samples from that density, is one of the fundamental
        challenges in unsupervised machine learning. We introduce a new generative
        model based on denoising density estimators (DDEs), which are scalar functions
        parametrized by neural networks, that are efficiently trained to represent
        kernel density estimators of the data. Leveraging DDEs, our main contribution
        is a novel technique to obtain generative models by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler
        (KL)-divergence directly. We prove that our algorithm for obtaining generative
        models is guaranteed to converge consistently to the correct solution. Our
        approach does not require specific network architecture as in normalizing
        flows (NFs), nor use ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers as in continuous
        NFs. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvement in …

      abstract: We present a novel system for sketch-based face image editing, enabling
        users to edit images intuitively by sketching a few strokes on a region of
        interest. Our interface features tools to express a desired image manipulation
        by providing both geometry and color constraints as user-drawn strokes. As
        an alternative to the direct user input, our proposed system naturally supports
        a copy-paste mode, which allows users to edit a given image region by using
        parts of another exemplar image without the need of hand-drawn sketching at
        all. The proposed interface runs in real-time and facilitates an interactive
        and iterative workflow to quickly express the intended edits. Our system is
        based on a novel sketch domain and a convolutional neural network trained
        end-to-end to automatically learn to render image regions corresponding to
        the input strokes. To achieve high quality and semantically consistent results
        we train our neural network on two simultaneous tasks, namely image completion
        and image translation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine
        these two tasks in a unified framework for interactive image editing. Our
        results show that the proposed sketch domain, network architecture, and training
        procedure generalize well to real user input and enable high quality synthesis
        results without additional post-processing.

      abstract: Tail biting is a damaging behaviour that impacts the welfare and health
        of pigs. Early detection of precursor signs of tail biting provides the opportunity
        to take preventive measures, thus avoiding the occurrence of the tail biting
        event. This study aimed to build a machine-learning algorithm for real-time
        detection of upcoming tail biting outbreaks, using feeding behaviour data
        recorded by an electronic feeder. Prediction capacities of seven machine learning
        algorithms (Generalized Linear Model with Stepwise Feature Selection, random
        forest, Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel, Bayesian
        Generalized Linear Model, Neural network, K-nearest neighbour, and Partial
        Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) were evaluated from daily feeding data
        collected from 65 pens originating from two herds of grower-finisher pigs
        (25-100kg), in which 27 tail biting events occurred. Data were divided into
        training and testing data in two different ways, either by randomly splitting
        data into 75% (training set) and 25% (testing set), or by randomly selecting
        pens to constitute the testing set. In the first data splitting, the model
        is regularly updated with previous data from the pen, whereas in the second
        data splitting, the model tries to predict for a pen that it has never seen
        before. The K-nearest neighbour algorithm was able to predict 78% of the upcoming
        events with an accuracy of 96%, when predicting events in pens for which it
        had previous data. Our results indicate that machine learning models can be
        considered for implementation into automatic feeder systems for real-time
        prediction of tail biting events.

      abstract: Different learning modes and mechanisms allow faster and better acquisition
        of skills as widely studied in humans and many animals. Specific neurons,
        called mirror neurons, are activated in the same way whether an action is
        performed or simply observed. This suggests that observing others performing
        movements allows to reinforce our motor abilities. This implies the presence
        of a biological mechanism that allows creating models of others' movements
        and linking them to the self-model for achieving mirroring. Inspired by such
        ability, we propose to build a map of movements executed by a teaching agent
        and mirroring the agent's state to the robot's configuration space. Hence,
        in this study, a neural network is proposed to integrate a motor cortex-like
        differential map transforming motor plans from task-space to joint-space motor
        commands and a static map correlating joint-spaces of the robot and a teaching
        agent. The differential map is developed based on spiking neural networks
        while the static map is built as a self-organising map. The developed neural
        network allows the robot to mirror the actions performed by a human teaching
        agent to its own joint-space and the reaching skill is refined by the complementary
        examples provided. Hence, experiments are conducted to quantify the improvement
        achieved thanks to the proposed learning approach and control scheme.

      abstract: The majority of operations carried out by the brain require learning
        complex signal patterns for future recognition, retrieval and reuse. Although
        learning is thought to depend on multiple forms of long-term synaptic plasticity,
        the way this latter contributes to pattern recognition is still poorly understood.
        Here, we have used a simple model of afferent excitatory neurons and interneurons
        with lateral inhibition, reproducing a network topology found in many brain
        areas from the cerebellum to cortical columns. When endowed with spike-timing
        dependent plasticity (STDP) at the excitatory input synapses and at the inhibitory
        interneuron–interneuron synapses, the interneurons rapidly learned complex
        input patterns. Interestingly, induction of plasticity required that the network
        be entrained into theta-frequency band oscillations, setting the internal
        phase-reference required to drive STDP. Inhibitory plasticity effectively

    ITsafnMAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC:
      abstract: Biological control systems are a source of inspiration for translating
        motor control principles into effective new designs for robot devices and
        controllers. Living organisms can perform many challenging tasks, eg, simultaneous
        execution and tight coordination of multiple movements, the exploration of
        the surrounding physical environment, and adaptation to changing contexts.
        Nowadays, there is a wide variety of robots, ranging from rigid industrial
        robot arms to soft animal-like robots. The robotics community is working toward
        the ambitious goal of deploying these robots in unstructured and unpredictable,
        real-life scenarios. Brain-inspired control principles can be seen as effective
        solutions for these problems. Technologies based on these principles can enable
        robots to operate in such challenging scenarios and open the door to new applications
        beyond conventional control approaches. However, their potential is still
        unexplored in robotics.This Research Topic was initiated to collect recent
        works on the development and experimental validation of biomimetic control
        architectures that combine biologically based approaches for the next generation
        of robotic systems. Overall, it comprises seven articles, five of which cover
        applications from the study to the design and modeling of bioinspired computing
        methods to achieve intelligence, flexibility, and adaptation for robotic applications
        such as locomotion, and manipulation. The remaining two articles regard the
        NeuroVis tool (Srisuchinnawong et al.) for real-time neural spatial-temporal
        information measurement and visualization, and a review on the whole-body
        nature of biological motor control that …

    ITsafnMAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC:
      abstract: The focus of the research community in the soft robotic field has
        been on developing innovative materials, but the design of control strategies
        applicable to these robotic platforms is still an open challenge. This is
        due to their highly nonlinear dynamics which is difficult to model and the
        degree of stochasticity they often incorporate. Data-driven controllers based
        on neural networks have recently been explored as a viable solution to be
        employed for these manipulators. This letter presents a neural network-based
        closed-loop controller, trained by a deep reinforcement learning algorithm
        called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). The training takes place in
        simulation, using an approximation of the robot forward dynamic model obtained
        with a Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The trained controller allows
        following different paths executed with different velocities in the workspace
        of the robot. The results …

      abstract: Neurorobotics has emerged from the alliance between neuroscience and
        robotics. It pursues the investigation of reproducing living organism-like
        behaviors in robots by means of the embodiment of computational models of
        the central nervous system. This perspective article discusses the current
        trend of implementing tools for the pressing challenge of early-diagnosis
        of neurodegenerative diseases and how neurorobotics approaches can help. Recently,
        advances in this field have allowed the testing of some neuroscientific hypotheses
        related to brain diseases, but the lack of biological plausibility of developed
        brain models and musculoskeletal systems has limited the understanding of
        the underlying brain mechanisms that lead to deficits in motor and cognitive
        tasks. Key aspects and methods to enhance the reproducibility of natural behaviors
        observed in healthy and impaired brains are proposed in this …

      abstract: This study proposes an adaptive control architecture based on an accurate
        regression method called Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) and
        on a bio-inspired module, such as a cerebellar-like engine. This hybrid architecture
        takes full advantage of the machine learning module (LWPR kernel) to abstract
        an optimized representation of the sensorimotor space while the cerebellar
        component integrates this to generate corrective terms in the framework of
        a control task. Furthermore, we illustrate how the use of a simple adaptive
        error feedback term allows to use the proposed architecture even in the absence
        of an accurate analytic reference model. The presented approach achieves an
        accurate control with low gain corrective terms (for compliant control schemes).
        We evaluate the contribution of the different components of the proposed scheme
        comparing the obtained performance with …

      abstract: Due to a general shift in manufacturing paradigm from mass production
        towards mass customization, reconfigurable automation technologies, such as
        robots, are required. However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously
        difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are
        introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories
        of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies
        that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises.
        In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills
        for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived
        from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred
        to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented
        on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the …

      abstract: Research and application of reinforcement learning in robotics for
        contact-rich manipulation tasks have exploded in recent years. Its ability
        to cope with unstructured environments and accomplish hard-to-engineer behaviors
        has led reinforcement learning agents to be increasingly applied in real-life
        scenarios. However, there is still a long way ahead for reinforcement learning
        to become a core element in industrial applications. This paper examines the
        landscape of reinforcement learning and reviews advances in its application
        in contact-rich tasks from 2017 to the present. The analysis investigates
        the main research for the most commonly selected tasks for testing reinforcement
        learning algorithms in both rigid and deformable object manipulation. Additionally,
        the trends around reinforcement learning associated with serial manipulators

      abstract: During the past decades, the increasing need for more flexible and
        agile manufacturing equipment has spawned a growing interest in collaborative
        robots. Contrary to traditional industrial robots, collaborative robots are
        intended for operating alongside the production personnel in dynamic or semi-structured
        human environments. To cope with the environment and workflow of humans, new
        programming and control methods are needed compared to those of traditional
        industrial robots. This paper presents a task-level programming software tool
        allowing robotic novices to program industrial tasks on a collaborative robot.
        The tool called Skill Based System (SBS) is founded on the concept of robot
        skills, which are parameterizable and task-related actions of the robot. Task
        programming is conducted by first sequencing skills followed by an online
        parameterization performed using kinesthetic teaching. Through …

      abstract: This article presents a unifying terminology for task-level programming
        of highly flexible mobile manipulators in industrial environments. With a
        terminology of tasks and object-centered skills, industrial applications are
        analyzed in the logistic and assistive domains. The analysis shows that many
        tasks can actually be solved with a small library of predefined building blocks,
        called skills. In logistics domains, it can be exploited that the sequences
        of skills needed to solve specific tasks follow certain patterns, whereas
        in assistive tasks, the sequence vary a lot, and tasks must be taught to the
        robot by a user, based on Standard Operating Procedures or process knowledge.
        An overview is presented on how to implement a skill-based architecture, enabling
        reuse of skills for different industrial applications, programmed by shopfloor
        workers. The terminology of tasks, skills, and motion primitives is introduced
        and designed to separate responsibilities of robot system developers, robot
        system integrators and shop floor users concerning programming of the robot
        system. The concept of testable pre-and postconditions assigned to the skills
        are proposed to help both in developing skills and asserting when a skill
        is applicable.

        small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered the economic backbone

      abstract: To enable flexible quality inspection in industrial manufacturing
        environments, there is an increasing demand for easy-to-use automation systems
        that can aid factory workers in repetitive tasks. However, quality-control
        tasks may be too complex for a single classification algorithm to deliver
        results comparable to a human operator. Therefore, we propose a computer-vision
        architecture to improve flexibility of quality inspection tasks, that first
        detects objects of interest, estimates their poses and defines regions-of-interest
        prior to the classification task takes place. The proposed hybrid architecture
        consists of a deep-learning based object detection and segmentation model,
        and edge-based pose estimation method. We validate our approaches in texture-less,
        reflecting and symmetric vehicle metal sheets which are challenging for state-of-the-art
        object detection and pose estimation methods. Furthermore, since annotating
        the data required by these methods is laborious and time-consuming, we train
        our object detection and pose estimation architectures on 3D synthetic datasets
        based on available CAD model. We demonstrate promising domain generalization
        results on the object detection stage of our architecture (Mask R-CNN) as
        while trained with synthetic data, it reaches a bounding box mAP of 0.781
        on synthetic and mAP of 0.686 on real images. On the other side, our simple
        edge-based pose estimation method can cope with texture-less parts even if
        using synthetic data as reference and being evaluated on real images. Our
        custom edge-based pose estimator reaches 16 of average rotation error and
        0.14 m of average translation error on real …

      abstract: Modern industrial systems are equipped with multi-sensor units, and
        building anomaly detection modules to monitor their collected data has become
        a vital task. Missing such abnormal patterns may cause producing faulty products,
        unwanted shutdowns in the production line, or even catastrophic damages. Sensor
        measurements of different natures with different sampling frequencies build
        a multivariate heterogeneous time series data. Conventional machine learning

      abstract: This paper describes an approach to representing, organising, and
        accessing conceptual content of biomedical texts using a formal ontology.
        The ontology is based on UMLS resources supplemented with domain ontologies
        developed in the project. The approach introduces the notion of ‘generative
        ontologies’, i.e., ontologies providing increasingly specialised concepts
        reflecting the phrase structure of natural language. Furthermore, we propose
        a novel so called ontological semantics which maps noun phrases from texts
        and queries into nodes in the generative ontology. This enables an advanced
        form of data mining of texts identifying paraphrases and concept relations
        and measuring distances between key concepts in texts. Thus, the project is
        distinct in its attempt to provide a formal underpinning of conceptual similarity
        or relatedness of meaning.

      abstract: Pyrrolysine (the 22nd amino acid) is in certain organisms and under
        certain circumstances encoded by the amber stop codon, UAG. The circumstances
        driving pyrrolysine translation are not well understood. The involvement of
        a predicted mRNA structure in the region downstream UAG has been suggested,
        but the structure does not seem to be present in all pyrrolysine incorporating
        genes. We propose a strategy to predict pyrrolysine encoding genes in genomes
        of archaea and bacteria. We cluster open reading frames interrupted by the
        amber codon based on sequence similarity. We rank these clusters according
        to several features that may influence pyrrolysine translation. The ranking
        effects of different features are assessed and we propose a weighted combination
        of these features which best explains the currently known pyrrolysine incorporating
        genes. We devote special attention to the effect of structural conservation
        and provide further substantiation to support that structural conservation
        may be influential - but is not a necessary factor. Finally, from the weighted
        ranking, we identify a number of potentially pyrrolysine incorporating genes.
        We propose a method for prediction of pyrrolysine incorporating genes in genomes
        of bacteria and archaea leading to insights about the factors driving pyrrolysine
        translation and identification of new gene candidates. The method predicts
        known conserved genes with high recall and predicts several other promising
        candidates for experimental verification. The method is implemented as a computational
        pipeline which is available on request.

      abstract: Relations used in biomedical ontologies and expressed in biomedical
        texts can be very general or very specific. Regulatory relations are used
        widely in regulatory networks, for example, and therefore they appear systematically
        and highly frequently in biomedical texts. This work focuses on the logical
        properties of positive and negative regulations, both as formal relations
        and the frequency of their usage as verbs in texts. The paper discusses whether
        there exists a weak transitivity-like property for the relations. Our corpora
        consist of biomedical patents, Medline abstracts and the British National
        Corpus (BNC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the relations for semantic

      abstract: The scientific aim of the project presented in this paper is to provide
        an approach to representing, organizing, and accessing conceptual content
        of biomedical texts using a formal ontology. The ontology is based on UMLS
        resources supplemented with domain ontologies developed in the project. The
        approach introduces the notion of ‘generative ontologies’, i.e., ontologies
        providing increasingly specialized concepts reflecting the phrase structure
        of natural language. Furthermore, we propose a novel so-called ‘ontological
        semantics’ which maps noun phrases from texts and queries into nodes in the
        generative ontology. This enables an advanced form of data mining of texts
        identifying paraphrases and concept relations and measuring distances between
        key concepts in texts. Thus, the project gains its identity in its attempt
        to provide a formal underpinning of conceptual similarity or relatedness of
        meaning.

      abstract: 'The introduction of algorithmic decision-making into organizational
        reality is strategic in (at least) two respects: first, what strategic visions
        and ambitions underpin decisions to develop and deploy algorithms? And second,
        how do algorithms, once introduced, shape organizations’ strategic capabilities?
        Underlying these questions is a concern with explainability; if strategy is
        the organization’s means of making itself known to itself and others (Holt,
        2018), what happens when this knowing becomes algorithmic? In this paper,
        we offer a conceptual framework for answering this question. To do so, we
        define strategizing algorithms as the organization of blended valuation, understood
        as valuation practices that are performed by multiple (human/non-human) actors
        in conjunction. To further specify such practices, we suggest that strategizing
        algorithms reconfigure the rationality of strategy-making along temporal,
        spatial, and agential axes.'

      abstract: Using unconditional basic income (UBI) as its empirical prism, this
        article offers new impetus to the foundational debate within critical theory
        as to whether and how redistribution and recognition can relate productively
        to each other. We explore the possibility of redistributive solidarity, arguing
        that unconditional and universal redistribution may be a means of furthering
        the recognition of different subjectivities that are not solely defined by
        their productive relations of labor. Seeing such redistributive solidarity
        as a potential but not necessary outcome of UBI, we develop a typology of
        existing UBI experiments that divide these according to whether they seek
        to affirm or transform the current social order based on principles of growth
        or degrowth. Surveying these four types of UBI, we find that the envisioned
        form of economic redistribution shapes the potential for social recognition.

      abstract: In this article we argue that although there has been an intensified
        exploration of how organizations strategize within the field of strategic
        communication, there seems to be a key component missing, namely questioning
        who these organizations are and become in the process of strategizing. Strategic
        communication implicitly, perhaps even unintentionally, continues to rely
        on a classical understanding of organizations as “social units (or human groupings)
        deliberately constructed and reconstructed to seek specific goals” (Etzioni,
        1964, p. 3). Assuming rather than exploring who the organization is, we argue,
        hinders a full explanation of how strategic communication works. Aiming to
        tackle this issue, we first present three ways in which the classical understanding
        of organizations is being theoretically challenged by organization studies
        and empirically challenged by new media, arguing that organizations are …

        informally online. Through the (threat of) disconnection, members may (re)assert

        of within-movement activism that relies both on social media affordances and

        how individual members of the LGBTI+ community were able to influence the

        which directly involves the recipient in the construction of an argument.
        This form is becoming increasingly common, and the present article explores

        reliance on participatory and digital rhetoric. We then proceed to examine
        game-based persuasion in light of rhetorical theory, and we propose an analytical
        model for such games which is applied to three sample games. The analytical
        model takes into account the degree to which the game makes a self-contained
        argument, the degree to which the product or service is integrated into the
        game, and whether the game goal and learning goal overlap. Finally, we discuss
        perspectives for the integration of communication studies and game studies.

      abstract: 1. Introduction n the 18th of June 2004 the political leaders of the
        25 member states of the European Union (EU) agreed on a Treaty establishing
        a Constitution for Europe. However, the agreement was reached in the shadow
        of a spectacular failure and was not presented as the triumph of European
        concord one might have expected. The process of creating a new foundational
        text for the EU should have been sealed when the leaders met in December of
        2003, but on that occasion the assembled politicians could neither agree on
        the proposal that was on the table, nor could they reach a compromise or partial
        solution. All the heads of state and government could decide at the meeting
        in December 2003 was to spend the first quarter of 2004 probing how the pieces
        could be mended and to recommence the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC),
        the institutional arrangement for deciding on treaty changes, as soon as possible.
        As it turned out, the unsuccessful summit did not terminate the European constitutional
        process as such. Nevertheless, it halted nearly four years of perpetual, if
        sometimes almost imperceptible, movement towards refounding the EU by means
        of a single constitutional text.Before the December summit a proposal for
        a fully-fledged constitution had been prepared by the so-called European Convention,
        a temporary institution consisting of national and European parliamentarians
        and representatives of the executives. During its working period from March
        2002 to July 2003 the Convention took on more and more features of a constitutional

      abstract: Speech enhancement techniques improve the quality or the intelligibility
        of an audio signal by removing unwanted noise. It is used as preprocessing
        in numerous applications such as speech recognition, hearing aids, broadcasting
        and telephony. The evaluation of such algorithms often relies on reference-based
        objective metrics that are shown to correlate poorly with human perception.
        In order to evaluate audio quality as perceived by human observers it is thus
        fundamental to resort to subjective quality assessment and in doing so we
        identify subgroups of users where the subjective assessments correlate better

      abstract: State-of-the-art speech codecs achieve a good compromise between quality,
        bitrate and complexity. However, retaining performance outside the target
        bitrate range remains challenging. To improve performance, many codecs use
        pre-and post-filtering techniques to reduce the perceptual effect of quantization-noise.
        In this paper, we propose a postfiltering method to attenuate quantization
        noise which uses the complex spectral correlations of speech signals. Since
        conventional speech codecs cannot transmit information with temporal dependencies
        as transmission errors could result in severe error propagation, we model
        the correlation offline and employ them at the decoder, hence removing the
        need to transmit any side information. Objective evaluation indicates an average
        4 dB improvement in the perceptual SNR of signals using the contextbased post-filter,
        with respect to the noisy signal, and an average 2 dB …

      abstract: Advanced coding algorithms yield high quality signals with good coding
        efficiency within their target bit-rate ranges, but their performance suffer
        outside the target range. At lower bitrates, the degradation in performance
        is because the decoded signals are sparse, which gives a perceptually muffled
        and distorted characteristic to the signal. Standard codecs reduce such distortions
        by applying noise filling and post-filtering methods. In this paper, we propose
        a post-processing method based on modeling the inherent time-frequency correlation
        in the log-magnitude spectrum. The goal is to improve the perceptual SNR of
        the decoded signals and, to reduce the distortions caused by signal sparsity.
        Objective measures show an average improvement of 1.5 dB for input perceptual
        SNR in range 4 to 18 dB. The improvement is especially prominent in components
        which had been quantized to zero.

      abstract: Blood-volume-pulse (BVP) is a biosignal commonly used in applications
        for non-invasive affect recognition and wearable technology. However, its
        predisposition to noise constitutes limitations for its application in real-life
        settings. This paper revisits BVP processing and proposes standard practices
        for feature extraction from empirical observations of BVP. We propose a method
        for improving the use of features in the presence of noise and compare it
        to a standard signal processing approach of a 4th order Butterworth bandpass
        filter with cut-off frequencies of 1 Hz and 8 Hz. Our method achieves better
        results for most time features as well as for a subset of the frequency features.
        We find that all but one time feature and around half of the frequency features
        perform better when the noisy parts are known (best case). When the noisy
        parts are unknown and estimated using a metric of skewness, the proposed method
        in general works better or similar to the Butterworth bandpass filter, but
        both methods also fail for a subset features. Our results can be used to select
        BVP features that are meaningful under different SNR conditions.

        store their data and the ways in which the data can be applied. Privacy with
        devices and services operated by the voice are of particular interest. To
        enable studies in privacy, this paper presents a database which quantifies
        the experience of privacy users have in spoken communication. We focus on
        the effect of the acoustic environment on that perception of privacy. Speech
        signals are recorded in scenarios simulating real-life situations, where the
        acoustic environment has an effect on the experience of privacy. The acoustic
        data is complemented with measures of the speakers’ experience of privacy,
        recorded using a questionnaire. The presented corpus enables studies in how
        acoustic environments affect peoples’ experience of privacy, which in turn,
        can be used to develop speech operated applications which are respectful of
        their right to privacy.

        and adolescents. Here, we present an analysis plan and statistical report
        for the study to document our a priori hypotheses and increase the robustness
        of the findings of our planned study.Methods: Audio recordings of clinical
        interviews of 47 children and adolescents with OCD and 17 children and adolescents
        without a psychiatric diagnosis will be analyzed. Youths were between 8 and
        17 years old. We will test the effect of OCD diagnosis on computationally
        derived scores of vocal activation using ANOVA. To test the effect of OCD
        severity classifications on the same computationally derived vocal scores,
        we will perform a logistic regression. Finally, we will attempt to create
        an improved indicator of OCD severity by refining the model with more relevant
        labels. Models will be adjusted for age and gender. Model validation strategies
        are outlined.Results: Simulated results are presented. The actual results
        using real data will be presented in future publications.Conclusions: A major
        strength of this study is that we will include age and gender in our models
        to increase classification accuracy. A major challenge is the suboptimal quality
        of the audio recordings, which are representative of in-the-wild data and
        a large body of recordings collected during …'

      abstract: 'Behavioral observation is an important tool for research and practice
        in clinical, developmental, and social psychology. Traditional, expert-based
        methods for behavioral observation from videos are limited by the amount of
        time and resources it requires. Artificial intelligence tools are available
        that can automatically and reliably code specific emotions and behaviors.
        However, the generated output is not specifically aligned to applications
        in psychology. We present methods for automating behavioral coding using open
        source software and provide an overview of available sources and instructions
        on how they can be applied to generate codes from widely used behavioral coding
        manuals. Using two examples, we describe methods for applying open source
        computer vision and hearing tools to code behavior in two settings: a parent-child
        interaction and a psychotherapeutic exposure session. We use a modular approach,
        defining specific behaviors with features extracted with computer vision and
        hearing tools that can be combined into higher order constructs. Modules can
        be combined in different ways to allow a flexible application to a variety
        of coding manuals or observational tasks. In addition, we propose ways of
        testing the validity of the automated codes. Some modalities are better suited
        than others for specific tasks. For example, the performance of computer vision
        tools is excellent for detecting emotion, whereas speech signal processing
        is less sensitive to detecting specific emotions. However, speech is better
        suited for detecting vocalization than computer vision. Issues of privacy

      abstract: 'Introduction Obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) are marked by distress,
        negative emotions, mental processes and behaviors that are reflected in physiological
        signals such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and temperature. Continuous
        monitoring of physiological signals associated with OCD symptoms may make
        measures of OCD more objective and facilitate close monitoring of prodromal
        symptoms, treatment progress and risk of relapse. Thus, we explored the feasibility
        of capturing OCD events in the real world using an unobtrusive wrist worn
        biosensor and machine learning models.Methods Nine children and adolescents
        (mean age= 12.3, SD= 2.6) with mild to severe OCD were recruited from child
        and adolescent mental health services. Participants were asked to wear the
        biosensor in the lab during conditions of rest and exposure to OCD symptom-triggering
        stimuli and for up to eight weeks in their everyday lives and register OCD
        events, ie, every time their OCD symptoms caused distress. We explored the
        relationships among the amount of physiological data, registered OCD events,
        age, OCD symptom severity and symptom types. In the machine learning models,
        we considered detection of OCD events as a binary classification problem.
        A two-layer cross validation strategy with either random 10-folds, leave-one-person
        out, or leave-week (s)-out in both layers was used. We compared the performance
        of four models: logistic regression, random forest (RF), feedforward neural

      abstract: A common issue in coding speech and audio in the frequency domain,
        which appears with decreasing bitrate, is that quantization levels become
        increasingly sparse. With low accuracy, high-frequency components are typically
        quantized to zero, which leads to a muffled output signal and musical noise.
        Bandwidth extension and noise-filling methods attempt to treat the problem
        by inserting noise of similar energy as the original signal, at the cost of
        low signal to noise ratio. Dithering methods however provide an alternative
        approach, where both accuracy and energy are retained. We propose a hybrid
        coding approach where low-energy samples are quantized using dithering, instead
        of the conventional uniform quantizer. For dithering, we apply 1 bit quantization
        in a randomized sub-space. We further show that the output energy can be adjusted
        to the desired level using a scaling parameter. Objective …

        practical and sustainable decentralized identity solutions, such as scalability
        issues, high transaction fees, and energy consumption. However, Decentralized
        Identifiers (DIDs) with IOTA’s Tangle technology offer a promising solution

      abstract: During the last years, researche'rs have proposed solutions to help
        smartphones improve execution time and reduce energy consumption by offloading
        heavy tasks to remote entities. Lately, inspired by the promising results
        of message forwarding in opportunistic networks, many researchers have proposed
        strategies for task offloading towards nearby mobile devices, giving birth
        to the Device-to-Device offloading paradigm. None of these strategies, though,
        offers any mechanism that considers selfish users and, most importantly, that
        motivates and defrays the participating devices who spend their resources.
        In this paper, we address these problems and propose the design of a framework
        that integrates an incentive scheme and a reputation mechanism. Our proposal
        follows the principles of the Hidden Market Design approach, which allows

      abstract: The integration of IoT devices is becoming increasingly inevitable
        in the development of next-generation systems and applications. Due to such
        a wide adoption, IoT devices handle large quantities of private and sensitive
        data, and operate safety-critical systems. As such, failure to comply with
        security requirements would prove to be catastrophic. However, the resource-constrained
        nature of IoT devices is a fundamental limitation in designing their security
        features. To tackle the problem of implementing lightweight security functionalities
        that enable trusted communications, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have
        been proposed. Exploiting the manufacturing variations of Integrated Circuits
        (ICs), these primitives aim to give devices a unique identifier that no attacker
        can violate or clone. That said, in the past decade many studies have shown
        the great threat that Machine Learning (ML) poses to the security of …

      abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are lightweight security primitives
        capable of providing functionalities such as device authentication and identification.
        Such lightweight solutions are particularly important for small resource-constrained
        devices that cannot support many of the standard security mechanisms like
        e.g., TPMs. Even though PUFs are constructed to be unpredictable and unclonable,
        they have been susceptible to Machine Learning (ML) modeling attacks. Mitigation
        of these attacks typically requires additional hardware, causing potential
        deviation from the lightweight nature of low-end embedded devices. In this
        paper, we analyze the technical details that lead to the success of the previous
        ML modeling attacks, and utilize these findings to devise a novel challenge-response
        approach that improves PUF's security, more specifically the 4-XOR and 5-XOR
        PUFs, without additional hardware …

      abstract: Although immunotherapy (IO) has changed the paradigm for the treatment
        of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancers (aNSCLC), only around
        30% to 50% of treated patients experience a long-term benefit from IO. Furthermore,
        the identification of the 30 to 50% of patients who respond remains a major
        challenge, as programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is currently the only biomarker
        used to predict the outcome of IO in NSCLC patients despite its limited efficacy.
        Considering the dynamic complexity of the immune system-tumor microenvironment

      abstract: In the past few years, large high-resolution displays (LHRDs) have
        attracted considerable attention from researchers, industries, and application
        areas that increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making. An up-to-date

        to summarize how new solutions meet the characteristics and requirements of
        LHRDs and take advantage of their unique benefits. In this survey, we start
        by defining LHRDs and outlining the consequence of LHRD environments on interactive
        visualizations in terms of more pixels, space, users, and devices. Then, we
        review related literature along the four axes of visualization, interaction,
        evaluation studies, and applications. With these four axes, our survey provides
        a unique perspective and covers a broad range of aspects being relevant when
        developing interactive visual data analysis solutions for LHRDs. We conclude
        this survey by reflecting on a number of opportunities for future research
        to help the community take up the still open challenges of interactive visualization

      abstract: 'Measurement of care quality and safety mainly relies on abstracted
        administrative data. However, it is well studied that administrative data-based
        adverse event (AE) detection methods are suboptimal due to lack of clinical
        information. Electronic medical records (EMR) have been widely implemented
        and contain detailed and comprehensive information regarding all aspects of
        patient care, offering a valuable complement to administrative data. Harnessing
        the rich clinical data in EMRs offers a unique opportunity to improve detection,
        identify possible risk factors of AE and enhance surveillance. However, the
        methodological tools for detection of AEs within EMR need to be developed

      abstract: This paper draws together nine strategies for creative visualization
        activities. Teaching visualization often involves running learning activities
        where students perform tasks that directly support one or more topics that
        the teacher wishes to address in the lesson. As a group of educators and researchers
        in visualization, we reflect on our learning experiences. Our activities and
        experiences range from dividing the tasks into smaller parts, considering
        different learning materials, to encouraging debate. With this paper, our
        hope is that we can encourage, inspire, and guide other educators with visualization
        activities. Our reflections provide an initial starting point of methods and
        strategies to craft creative visualisation learning activities, and provide
        a foundation for developing best practices in visualization education.

        opportunities in running data visualization design activities in the context
        of large courses. With the increasing number and sizes of data visualization
        course, we need to better understand approaches to scaling our teaching efforts.
        We draw on experiences organizing and facilitating activities primarily based
        on one instance of a master''s course given to about 130 students. We provide
        a detailed account of the course with particular focus on the purpose, structure,
        and outcome of six two-hour design activities. Based on this, we reflect on
        three aspects of the course: First, how the course scale led us to thoroughly
        plan, evaluate, and revise communication between students, teaching assistants,
        and lecturers. Second, how we designed learning scaffolds through the design
        activities, and the reflections we received from students on this matter.
        Finally, we reflect on the diversity of the students that followed the course,
        the visualization exercises we used, the projects they worked on, and when

      abstract: Large, high-resolution displays offer new opportunities for visualizing
        and interacting with data. However, interaction techniques for such displays
        mostly support window manipulation and pointing, ignoring many activities
        involved in data analysis. We report on 11 workshops with data analysts from
        various fields, including artistic photography, phone log analysis, astrophysics,
        and health care policy. Analysts were asked to walk through recent tasks using
        actual data on a large whiteboard, imagining it to be a large display. From
        the resulting comments and a video analysis of behavior in the workshops,
        we generate ideas for new interaction techniques for large displays. These
        ideas include supporting sequences of visualizations with backtracking and
        fluid exploration of alternatives; using distance to the display to change
        visualizations; and fixing variables and data sets on the display or relative
        to the user.

      abstract: Bayesian neural networks often approximate the weight-posterior with
        a Gaussian distribution. However, practical posteriors are often, even locally,
        highly non-Gaussian, and empirical performance deteriorates. We propose a
        simple parametric approximate posterior that adapts to the shape of the true
        posterior through a Riemannian metric that is determined by the log-posterior
        gradient. We develop a Riemannian Laplace approximation where samples naturally
        fall into weight-regions with low negative log-posterior. We show that these
        samples can be drawn by solving a system of ordinary differential equations,
        which can be done efficiently by leveraging the structure of the Riemannian
        metric and automatic differentiation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our
        approach consistently improves over the conventional Laplace approximation
        across tasks. We further show that, unlike the conventional Laplace approximation,
        our method is not overly sensitive to the choice of prior, which alleviates
        a practical pitfall of current approaches.

        encompasses 897k images of wine labels and 824k reviews of wines curated from
        the Vivino platform. It has over 350k unique vintages, annotated with year,
        region, rating, alcohol percentage, price, and grape composition. We obtained
        fine-grained flavor annotations on a subset by conducting a wine-tasting experiment
        with 256 participants who were asked to rank wines based on their similarity
        in flavor, resulting in more than 5k pairwise flavor distances. We propose
        a low-dimensional concept embedding algorithm that combines human experience
        with automatic machine similarity kernels. We demonstrate that this shared
        concept embedding space improves upon separate embedding spaces for coarse
        flavor classification (alcohol percentage, country, grape, price, rating)
        and aligns with the intricate human perception of flavor.

      abstract: Deep generative models provide a systematic way to learn nonlinear
        data distributions, through a set of latent variables and a nonlinear "generator"
        function that maps latent points into the input space. The nonlinearity of
        the generator imply that the latent space gives a distorted view of the input
        space. Under mild conditions, we show that this distortion can be characterized
        by a stochastic Riemannian metric, and demonstrate that distances and interpolants
        are significantly improved under this metric. This in turn improves probability
        distributions, sampling algorithms and clustering in the latent space. Our
        geometric analysis further reveals that current generators provide poor variance
        estimates and we propose a new generator architecture with vastly improved
        variance estimates. Results are demonstrated on convolutional and fully connected
        variational autoencoders, but the formalism easily generalize to other deep
        generative models.

      abstract: We consider kernel methods on general geodesic metric spaces and provide
        both negative and positive results. First we show that the common Gaussian
        kernel can only be generalized to a positive definite kernel on a geodesic
        metric space if the space is flat. As a result, for data on a Riemannian manifold,
        the geodesic Gaussian kernel is only positive definite if the Riemannian manifold
        is Euclidean. This implies that any attempt to design geodesic Gaussian kernels
        on curved Riemannian manifolds is futile. However, we show that for spaces
        with conditionally negative definite distances the geodesic Laplacian kernel
        can be generalized while retaining positive definiteness. This implies that
        geodesic Laplacian kernels can be generalized to some curved spaces, including
        spheres and hyperbolic spaces. Our theoretical results are verified empirically.

      abstract: Data augmentation is a key element in training high-dimensional models.
        In this approach, one synthesizes new observations by applying pre-specified
        transformations to the original training data; eg new images are formed by
        rotating old ones. Current augmentation schemes, however, rely on manual specification
        of the applied transformations, making data augmentation an implicit form
        of feature engineering. With an eye towards true end-to-end learning, we suggest
        learning the applied transformations on a per-class basis. Particularly, we
        align image pairs within each class under the assumption that the spatial
        transformation between images belongs to a large class of diffeomorphisms.
        We then learn a class-specific probabilistic generative models of the transformations
        in a Riemannian submanifold of the Lie group of diffeomorphisms. We demonstrate
        significant performance improvements in training deep neural nets over manually-specified
        augmentation schemes. Our code and augmented datasets are available online.

      abstract: In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model of retrieval of
        intentions from long-term memory. We model retrieval as a stochastic race
        between a plurality of potentially relevant intentions stored in long-term
        memory. Psychological theories are dominated by two opposing conceptions of
        the role of memory in temporally extended agency – as when a person has to
        remember to make a phone call in the afternoon because, in the morning, she
        promised she would do so. According to the Working Memory conception, remembering
        to make the phone call is explained in terms of the construction and maintenance
        of intentions in working-memory. According to the Long-Term Memory conception,

      abstract: In a masked priming experimental paradigm, we studied a possible subliminal
        perception effect on a semantic selection task (SST). To gauge the degree
        to which subjects solved the SST consciously, they subsequently reported their
        level of confidence of having made a correct response. This was done on each
        trial, and the subjects used individually constructed category rating scales
        to do so, in order to achieve a more sensitive measurement of which trials
        were influenced by conscious processes. During the construction of these individual
        rating scales, subjects verbally reported their experiences after each trial.
        The present study failed to find evidence of performance above chance level
        when subjects themselves reported to be at chance level. In fact, performance
        closely covaried with subjects' confidence ratings. About half of the subjects
        reported they would sometimes experience a 'feeling of knowing' (FOK …

      abstract: Based on the simple what first comes to mind rule, the theory of visual
        attention (TVA; Bundesen, 1990) provides a comprehensive account of visual
        attention that has been successful in explaining performance in visual categorization
        for a variety of attention tasks. If the stimuli to be categorized are mutually
        confusable, a response rule based on the amount of evidence collected over
        a longer time seems more appropriate. In this paper, we extend the idea of
        a simple race to continuous sampling of evidence in favor of a certain response
        category. The resulting Poisson random walk model is a TVA-based response
        time model in which categories are reported based on the amount of evidence
        obtained. We demonstrate that the model provides an excellent account for
        response time distributions obtained in speeded visual categorization tasks.

      abstract: When a person decides to do something in the future, she forms an
        intention and her intention persists. Philosophers have thought about the
        rational requirement that an agent’s intention persists until its execution.
        But philosophers have neglected to think about the causal memory mechanisms
        that could enable this kind of persistence and its role in rational long-term
        agency. Our aim of this paper is to fill this gap by arguing that memory for
        intention is a specific kind of memory. We do this by evaluating and rejecting
        standard declarative accounts of memory for intention and arguing for the
        plausibility of an alternative model of memory for intention. We argue for
        the alternative by spelling out a number of computational principles that
        could enable retaining and retrieving intentions from long-term memory. These
        principles could explain a number of core features of intentions.

      abstract: Learning to move the hands in particular ways is essential in many
        training andleisure virtual reality applications, yet challenging. Existing
        techniques that support learning of motor movement in virtual reality rely
        on external cues such as arrows showing where to move or transparent hands
        showing the target movement. We propose a technique where the avatar's hand
        movement is corrected to be closer to the target movement. This embeds guidance
        in the user's avatar, instead of in external cues and minimizes visual distraction.
        Through two experiments, we found that such movement guidance improves the
        short-term retention of the target movement when compared to a control condition
        without guidance.

        neural interpretation of C. Bundesen's (1990) theory of visual attention (TVA).
        In NTVA, visual processing capacity is distributed across stimuli by dynamic
        remapping of receptive fields of cortical cells such that more processing
        resources (cells) are devoted to behaviorally important objects than to less
        important ones. By use of the same basic equations used in TVA, NTVA accounts
        for a wide range of known attentional effects in human performance (reaction
        times and error rates) and a wide range of effects observed in firing rates
        of single cells in the primate visual system. NTVA provides a mathematical
        framework to unify the 2 fields of research--formulas bridging cognition and

      abstract: With the development of new methodologies for faster training on datasets,
        there is a need to provide an in-depth explanation of the workings of such
        methods. This paper attempts to provide an understanding for one such correlation
        filter-based tracking technology, Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF), which
        uses implicit properties of tracked images (circulant matrices) for training
        and tracking in real-time. It is unlike deep learning, which is data intensive.
        KCF uses implicit dynamic properties of the scene and movements of image patches
        to form an efficient representation based on the circulant structure for further
        processing, using properties such as diagonalizing in the Fourier domain.
        The computational efficiency of KCF, which makes it ideal for low-power heterogeneous
        computational processing technologies, lies in its ability to compute data
        in high-dimensional feature space without explicitly invoking the computation
        on this space. Despite its strong practical potential in visual tracking,
        there is a need for an in-depth critical understanding of the method and its
        performance, which this paper aims to provide. Here we present a survey of
        KCF and its method along with an experimental study that highlights its novel

    LW9fQacAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C:
      abstract: Visual tracking as a field of research has undergone tremendous progress
        in the past decade. Researchers around the world have presented state-of-art
        trackers which work in presence of occlusions, clutter, variations in illumination
        and many others. Despite the significant progress the challenge continues
        in presenting real-time trackers which are computationally efficient and accurate.
        Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) is one of the recent finding which has
        shown good results. Based on the idea of traditional correlational filter,
        it uses kernel trick and circulant matrices to significantly improve the computation
        speed. Given the complexity of this tracker, a clear step-by-step explanation
        is highly desirable in order to fully appreciate and expedite the research
        in real-time visual tracking. This paper aims to make the understanding of
        this tracker simpler for the benefit of the research community.

      abstract: 'Visual tracking performance has long been limited by the lack of
        better appearance models. These models fail either where they tend to change
        rapidly, like in motion-based tracking, or where accurate information of the
        object may not be available, like in color camouflage (where background and
        foreground colors are similar). This paper proposes a robust, adaptive appearance
        model which works accurately in situations of color camouflage, even in the
        presence of complex natural objects. The proposed model includes depth as
        an additional feature in a hierarchical modular neural framework for online
        object tracking. The model adapts to the confusing appearance by identifying
        the stable property of depth between the target and the surrounding object(s).
        The depth complements the existing RGB features in scenarios when RGB features
        fail to adapt, hence becoming unstable over a long duration of time. The parameters
        of the model are learned efficiently in the Deep network, which consists of
        three modules: (1) The spatial attention layer, which discards the majority
        of the background by selecting a region containing the object of interest;
        (2) the appearance attention layer, which extracts appearance and spatial
        information about the tracked object; and (3) the state estimation layer,
        which enables the framework to predict future object appearance and location.
        Three different models were trained and tested to analyze the effect of depth
        along with RGB information. Also, a model is proposed to utilize only depth

      abstract: Recent improvements to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
        made it possible to generate realistic images in high resolution based on
        natural language descriptions such as image captions. Furthermore, conditional
        GANs allow us to control the image generation process through labels or even
        natural language descriptions. However, fine-grained control of the image
        layout, i.e. where in the image specific objects should be located, is still
        difficult to achieve. This is especially true for images that should contain
        multiple distinct objects at different spatial locations. We introduce a new
        approach which allows us to control the location of arbitrarily many objects
        within an image by adding an object pathway to both the generator and the
        discriminator. Our approach does not need a detailed semantic layout but only
        bounding boxes and the respective labels of the desired objects are needed.
        The object pathway focuses solely on the individual objects and is iteratively
        applied at the locations specified by the bounding boxes. The global pathway
        focuses on the image background and the general image layout. We perform experiments
        on the Multi-MNIST, CLEVR, and the more complex MS-COCO data set. Our experiments
        show that through the use of the object pathway we can control object locations
        within images and can model complex scenes with multiple objects at various
        locations. We further show that the object pathway focuses on the individual
        objects and learns features relevant for these, while the global pathway focuses
        on global image characteristics and the image background.

        however, such services do not accept language models or grammars but process
        free speech from any domain. While results are very good given the enormous
        size of the search space, results frequently contain out-of-domain words or
        constructs that cannot be understood by subsequent domain-dependent natural
        language understanding (NLU) components. We present a versatile post-processing
        technique based on phonetic distance that integrates domain knowledge with
        open-domain ASR results, leading to improved ASR performance. Notably, our
        technique is able to make use of domain restrictions using various degrees
        of domain knowledge, ranging from pure vocabulary restrictions via grammars
        or N-Grams to restrictions of the acceptable utterances. We present results
        for a variety of corpora (mainly from human-robot interaction) where our combined
        approach significantly outperforms Google ASR as well as a plain open-source
        ASR solution.

      abstract: Advancements in Human-Robot Interaction involve robots being more
        responsive and adaptive to the human user they are interacting with. For example,
        robots model a personalised dialogue with humans, adapting the conversation
        to accommodate the user's preferences in order to allow natural interactions.
        This study investigates the impact of such personalised interaction capabilities
        of a human companion robot on its social acceptance, perceived intelligence
        and likeability in a human-robot interaction scenario. In order to measure
        this impact, the study makes use of an object learning scenario where the
        user teaches different objects to the robot using natural language. An interaction
        module is built on top of the learning scenario which engages the user in
        a personalised conversation before teaching the robot to recognise different
        objects. The two systems, i.e. with and without the interaction module, are

      abstract: Furigana are pronunciation notes used in Japanese writing. Being able
        to detect these can help improve optical character recognition (OCR) performance
        or make more accurate digital copies of Japanese written media by correctly
        displaying furigana. This project focuses on detecting furigana in Japanese
        books and comics. While there has been research into the detection of Japanese
        text in general, there are currently no proposed methods for detecting furigana.
        We construct a new dataset containing Japanese written media and annotations
        of furigana. We propose an evaluation metric for such data which is similar
        to the evaluation protocols used in object detection except that it allows
        groups of objects to be labeled by one annotation. We propose a method for
        detection of furigana that is based on mathematical morphology and connected
        component analysis. We evaluate the detections of the dataset and compare
        different methods for text extraction. We also evaluate different types of
        images such as books and comics individually and discuss the challenges of
        each type of image. The proposed method reaches an F1-score of 76\% on the
        dataset. The method performs well on regular books, but less so on comics,
        and books of irregular format. Finally, we show that the proposed method can
        improve the performance of OCR by 5\% on the manga109 dataset. Source code

      abstract: Generative adversarial networks conditioned on textual image descriptions
        are capable of generating realistic-looking images. However, current methods
        still struggle to generate images based on complex image captions from a heterogeneous
        domain. Furthermore, quantitatively evaluating these text-to-image models
        is challenging, as most evaluation metrics only judge image quality but not
        the conformity between the image and its caption. To address these challenges
        we introduce a new model that explicitly models individual objects within
        an image and a new evaluation metric called  Semantic Object Accuracy  (SOA)
        that specifically evaluates images given an image caption. The SOA uses a
        pre-trained object detector to evaluate if a generated image contains objects
        that are mentioned in the image caption, e.g., whether an image generated
        from  “a car driving down the street”  contains a car. We perform a …

        and interaction capabilities and flexible design. This combination makes it

      abstract: Human infants are able to acquire natural language seemingly easily
        at an early age. Their language learning seems to occur simultaneously with
        learning other cognitive functions as well as with playful interactions with
        the environment and caregivers. From a neuroscientific perspective, natural
        language is embodied, grounded in most, if not all, sensory and sensorimotor
        modalities, and acquired by means of crossmodal integration. However, characterizing
        the underlying mechanisms in the brain is difficult and explaining the grounding
        of language in crossmodal perception and action remains challenging. In this
        paper, we present a neurocognitive model for language grounding which reflects
        bio-inspired mechanisms such as an implicit adaptation of timescales as well
        as end-to-end multimodal abstraction. It addresses developmental robotic interaction
        and extends its learning capabilities using larger-scale knowledge-based data.
        In our scenario, we utilize the humanoid robot NICO in obtaining the EMIL
        data collection, in which the cognitive robot interacts with objects in a
        children's playground environment while receiving linguistic labels from a
        caregiver. The model analysis shows that crossmodally integrated representations
        are sufficient for acquiring language merely from sensory input through interaction
        with objects in an environment. The representations self-organize hierarchically
        and embed temporal and spatial information through composition and decomposition.
        This model can also provide the basis for further crossmodal integration of
        perceptually grounded cognitive representations.

        expression approximately forms a linear trajectory in the expression subspace,
        and all these linear trajectories intersect in a single point which corresponds
        to the point of no expression or the point of apathy. After centring our analysis

        the greatest challenges for automatic analysis of facial expressions. In this
        paper, we propose a feature describing expression intensity over time, while
        being invariant to person and the type of performed expression. Our feature
        is a weighted combination of the dynamics of multiple points adapted to the
        overall expression trajectory. We evaluate our method on several tasks all
        related to temporal analysis of facial expression. The proposed feature is
        compared to a state-of-the-art method for expression intensity estimation,
        which it outperforms. We use our proposed feature to temporally align multiple
        sequences of recorded 3D facial expressions. Furthermore, we show how our
        feature can be used to reveal person-specific differences in performances
        of facial expressions. Additionally, we apply our feature to identify the
        local changes in face video sequences based on action unit labels. For all

    kSuLm58AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC:
      abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for combining non-rigid structure-from-motion
        (NRSfM) with deep generative models, and propose an efficient framework for
        discovering trajectories in the latent space of 2D GANs corresponding to changes
        in 3D geometry. Our approach uses recent advances in NRSfM and enables editing
        of the camera and non-rigid shape information associated with the latent codes
        without needing to retrain the generator. This formulation provides an implicit
        dense 3D reconstruction as it enables the image synthesis of novel shapes
        from arbitrary view angles and non-rigid structure. The method is built upon
        a sparse backbone, where a neural regressor is first trained to regress parameters
        describing the cameras and sparse non-rigid structure directly from the latent
        codes. The latent trajectories associated with changes in the camera and structure
        parameters are then identified by estimating the local inverse of the regressor
        in the neighborhood of a given latent code. The experiments show that our
        approach provides a versatile, systematic way to model, analyze, and edit
        the geometry and non-rigid structures of faces.

      title: Controllable GAN Synthesis Using Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion
    kSuLm58AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC:
      abstract: In this work we present a method that combines tensor-based face modelling
        and analysis and non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSFM). The core idea is
        to see that the conventional tensor formulation for the face structure and
        expression analysis can be utilised while the structure component can be directly
        analysed as the non-rigid structure-from-motion problem. To the NRSFM problem
        part we further present a novel prior-free approach that factorises the 2D
        input shapes into affine projection matrices, rank-one 3D affine basis shapes,
        and the basis shape coefficients. The linear combination of the basis shapes
        thus yields the recovered 3D shapes upto an affine transformation. In contrast
        to most works in literature, no calibration information of the cameras or
        structure prior is required. Experiments on challenging face datasets show
        that our method, with and without the metric upgrade, is accurate and fast
        when compared to the state-of-the-art and is well suitable for dense reconstruction
        and face editing.

    kSuLm58AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC:
      abstract: In this work, we present a new versatile 3D multilinear statistical
        face model, based on a tensor factorisation of 3D face scans, that decomposes
        the shapes into person and expression subspaces. Investigation of the expression
        subspace reveals an inherent low-dimensional substructure, and further, a
        star-shaped structure. This is due to two novel findings. (1) Increasing the
        strength of one emotion approximately forms a linear trajectory in the subspace.
        (2) All these trajectories intersect at a single point – not at the neutral
        expression as assumed by almost all prior works—but at an  apathetic  expression.
        We utilise these structural findings by reparameterising the expression subspace
        by the fourth-order moment tensor centred at the point of apathy. We propose
        a 3D face reconstruction method from single or multiple 2D projections by
        assuming an uncalibrated projective camera model. The non-linearity caused
        by …

      abstract: 'In this paper, we use a tensor model based on the Higher-Order Singular
        Value Decomposition (HOSVD) to discover semantic directions in Generative
        Adversarial Networks. This is achieved by first embedding a structured facial
        expression database into the latent space using the e4e encoder. Specifically,
        we discover directions in latent space corresponding to the six prototypical
        emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise, as well
        as a direction for yaw rotation. These latent space directions are employed
        to change the expression or yaw rotation of real face images. We compare our
        found directions to similar directions found by two other methods. The results
        show that the visual quality of the resultant edits are on par with State-of-the-Art.
        It can also be concluded that the tensor-based model is well suited for emotion
        and yaw editing, i.e., that the emotion or yaw rotation of a novel face image
        can be robustly changed without a significant effect on identity or other
        attributes in the images.'

    kSuLm58AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C:
      abstract: Nonrigid Structure-From-Motion is a well-known approach to estimate
        time-varying 3D structures from 2D input image sequences. For challenging
        problems such as the reconstruction of human faces, state-of-the-art approaches
        estimate statistical shape spaces from training data. It is common practice
        to use orthographic or weak-perspective camera models to map 3D to 2D points.
        We propose to use a projective camera model combined with a multilinear tensor-based
        face model, enabling approximation of a dense 3D face surface by sparse 2D
        landmarks. Using a projective camera is beneficial, as it is able to handle
        perspective projections and particular camera motions which are critical for
        affine models. We show how the nonlinearity of the projective model can be
        linearized so that its parameters can be estimated by an alternating-least-squares
        approach. This enables simple and fast estimation of the model …

      abstract: This paper presents TemPose, a novel skeleton-based transformer model
        designed for fine-grained motion recognition to improve understanding of the
        detailed player actions in badminton. The model utilizes multiple temporal
        and interaction layers to capture variable-length multi-person human actions
        while minimizing reliance on non-human visual context. TemPose is evaluated
        on two fine-grained badminton datasets, where it significantly outperforms
        other baseline models by incorporating additional input streams, such as the
        shuttlecock position, into the temporal transformer layers of the model. Additionally,
        TemPose demonstrates great versatility by achieving competitive results compared
        to other state-of-the-art skeleton-based models on the large-scale action
        recognition benchmark NTU RGB+ D. Experiments are conducted to explore how
        different model parameter configurations affect TemPose's performance. Additionally,
        a qualitative analysis of the temporal attention maps suggests that the model
        learns to prioritize frames of specific poses relevant to different actions
        while formulating an intuition of each individual's importance in the sequences.
        Overall, TemPose is an intuitive and versatile architecture that has the potential
        to be further developed and incorporated into other methods for managing human
        motion in sports with state-of-the-art results.

        CSCW community has been working on patient-clinician interaction for decades,
        the last years have seen a number of changes to care provision, motivated
        by the COVID-19 pandemic, the strong uptake of remote care technologies, or
        the introduction of patient-generated data technologies. Recent advancements
        in Artifcial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare also promise to impact patient-clinician
        interactions as we know it. For all these reasons, the workshop will engage
        in participatory discussions to take stock, analyse challenges from the feld,
        refect on opportunities for technologies, and craft future research agendas
        for CSCW research in healthcare.

        tools utilized for everyday coordination and monitoring. Our study reveals
        that these tools hid serious issues relating to both the distribution of socio-technical

        tools have been implemented in cardiology clinics because of the sociotechnical
        challenges during transitioning from algorithm development to real-world implementation.Objective:
        This study explored how an ML-based tool for predicting ventricular tachycardia
        and ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) could support clinical decision-making
        in the remote monitoring of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator

        feasibility and qualitative study, which included walkthroughs of 5 blinded
        retrospective patient cases, use of the prediction tool, and questionnaires
        and interview questions. All sessions were video recorded, and sessions evaluating

        tool was found to have potential for supporting decision-making in ICD remote
        monitoring by providing reassurance, increasing confidence, acting as a second
        opinion, reducing information search time, and enabling delegation of decisions
        to nurses and technicians. However, the prediction tool did not lead to changes

        four areas of mediatization: adaptations of specific technologies; interactions
        with the bereaved; transformations of funeral rites; and communications beyond
        the funeral service. In conclusion, we suggest that the mediatization process
        is a negotiation of, on the one hand, the need and growing demand for digital
        media into a traditions-bound business, and on the other hand, the funeral
        directors’ wish to care for the bereaved families through tactile, in-person
        relationships and emotional support.'

        track. The rather simple timeline relates to the death of a person, there
        is before, just around, and after death, appropriately named in a dead language:
        Ante Mortem, Peri Mortem, and Post Mortem. This review deals exclusively with
        the digital context of the physical death of existing human beings, as opposed
        to, eg, in-game death experience or memorials for fictional characters. These

      abstract: This paper proposes a distributed finite-time secondary controller
        to achieve average voltage regulation and proportionate current sharing within
        a finite settling time for autonomous network of dc microgrids. It is employed
        by using a distributed finite-time control approach which maintains average
        voltage regulation of the system facilitating proportionate current sharing
        simultaneously by virtue of dynamic consensus between its neighbors. The proposed
        scheme ensures an improved performance over the conventional distributed secondary
        methods by reducing overshoots and chattering which is significant for critical
        operation of the loads. The proposed control strategy is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink
        environment to test link-failure resiliency, plug and play capability, and
        controller performance under communication delays within a tolerable upper
        bound on delay determined using time-delay analysis. Moreover …

      abstract: The development of power electronics-based medium voltage direct current
        (MVDC) networks has revolutionized the marine industry by enabling all-electric
        ships (AES). This technology facilitates the integration of heterogeneous
        resources and improves efficiency. The independent shipboard power system
        (SPS) is controlled by exchanging measurements and control signals over a
        communication network. However, the reliance on communication channels raises
        concerns about the potential exploitation of vulnerabilities leading to cyber-attacks
        that could disrupt the system. In this paper, a notional 12 kV MVDC SPS model
        with zonal electrical distribution system (ZEDS) architecture is considered
        as an exemplary model. As the system stability is closely linked to the transient
        performance, we investigate how to determine the operational status of the
        system under potential data integrity attacks on the governor and exciter
        of the power generation modules (PGMs). Further, the impact of these attacks
        on the stability of rotor speed and the DC link voltage is derived and discussed.
        The simulation of the system is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment.

        for interfacing renewable energy sources, energy storage, electrical vehicles,
        microgrids, and high-voltage dc transmission lines with the electrical power
        grid. As the number of power converters in modern grids continually increases,
        their monitoring and coordinated control in a way to support the grid have
        become topics of increased practical and research interest. In connection
        with this, latest standards have also defined a mandatory set of control parameters

        sends commands through a communication network. While such a remote control

      abstract: Real-time simulation is increasingly employed in the validation of
        power electronics and systems, showing great potential in terms of flexibility
        and efficiency. With it, electrical behaviors of power converters can be simulated
        with high accuracy. However, when evaluating the reliability of converters,
        the switching behaviors of power semiconductors should be simulated, which
        normally requires a rather high sampling rate and powerful computational capability
        of the hardware platforms, and such simulations usually take much time Therefore,
        an efficient approach is introduced in this article to evaluate the thermal
        performances of power devices. Compared to the prior-art methods, the required
        sampling rate is much lower, and the proposed approach is also simpler, as
        only the three-phase current is sampled. The junction temperatures can be

      abstract: Cyber-physical microgrids are vulnerable to stealth attacks that can
        degrade their stability and operability by performing low-magnitude manipulations
        in a coordinated manner. This paper formulates the interactions between CSAs
        and microgrid defenders as a non-cooperative, zero-sum game. Additionally,
        it presents a hybrid Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy for distributed
        microgrids that can dynamically alter local control gains to achieve resiliency
        against Coordinated Stealth Attacks (CSAs). The proposed strategy reduces
        the success probability of attack(s) by making system dynamics less predictable.
        The framework also identifies and removes malicious injections by modifying
        secondary control weights assigned to them. The manipulated signals are reconstructed
        using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Digital Twin (DT) to preserve
        stability. To guarantee additional immunity against instability arising from
        gain alterations, MTD decisions are also validated (via utility and best response
        computations) using the DT before actual implementation. The DT is also used
        to find the minimum perturbation that defenders must achieve to invalidate
        an attacker's knowledge effectively.

      abstract: This paper investigates the impact of potential state-dependent false
        data injection cyber-attacks on frequency synchronization and active power
        management in islanded ac microgrids. One potential way of affecting microgrid
        reliability is by forcing a generation outage. Thus, the attacker could potentially
        aim to desynchronize inverter-based resources in microgrids by manipulating
        their frequency with malicious injections. The attack signals are injected
        to manipulate control input channels, sensor nodes, reference values, and
        the information exchanged through communication networks. In order to mitigate
        the adverse impacts of such cyber-attacks, firstly, the conventional distributed
        consensus-based secondary control approach is modified and complemented in
        the presence of cyber-attacks. Secondly, a resilient cooperative distributed

      abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive event-triggered communication-assisted

        law-based estimate of states to reduce communication burden. It overcomes
        the drawbacks of operating in an open loop manner between two triggering time
        instants in traditional zero-order hold-based event triggering schemes using
        a full state feedback control strategy to update the control input simultaneously.
        Moreover, real-time precision of information and model uncertainties is well
        dealt owing to the adaptive mechanism via an event-triggering condition designed
        using the Lyapunov technique to ensure the stability of the system. This strategy

      abstract: Though recent advancements in dc microgrids are largely based on distributed
        control strategies to enhance reliability and scalability, the absence of
        a centralized controller to check the global information makes these schemes
        highly susceptible to cyber attacks. Since false data injection attacks (FDIAs)
        are considered as a prominent attack methodology in dc microgrids, prior emphasis
        is usually laid on compromised sensors and controllers only related to dc
        voltages. Hence, this article first segregates the FDIAs on the output currents
        into  destablization  and  deception  attacks, based on the modeling of attack
        elements with respect to the consensus theory. Second, a discordant element
        based detection approach is designed to detect the attacked nodes accurately,

      abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative mechanism for detecting potentially
        deceptive cyber attacks that attempt to disregard average voltage regulation
        and current sharing in cyber-physical dc microgrids. Considering a set of
        conventional cyber attacks, the detection becomes fairly easy for distributed
        observer based techniques. However, a well-planned set of balanced attacks,
        termed as the stealth attack, can bypass the conventional observer based detection
        theory as the control objectives are met without any physical error involved.
        In this paper, we discuss the formulation and associated scope of instability
        from stealth attacks to deceive distributed observers realizing the necessary
        and sufficient conditions to model such attacks. To address this issue, a
        novel cooperative vulnerability factor (CVF) framework for each agent is introduced,
        which accurately identifies the attacked agent(s) under various scenarios.

        health and behavior data close to the individual patient are envisioned to
        enable personalized healthcare - and self-care. And yet, they are consumer

      abstract: 'Most commercial activity trackers are developed as consumer devices
        and not as clinical devices. The aim is to monitor and motivate sport activities,
        healthy living, and similar wellness purposes, and the devices are not designed

        for using wearable sensor devices in health care settings, and the separate
        realms of wellness tracking and disease self-monitoring are increasingly becoming
        blurred. However, patients’ experiences with activity tracking technologies
        designed for use outside the clinical context have received little academic

        related to self-care and their chronic illness. Our research question was:
        “How do patients with heart disease experience activity data in relation to

      abstract: Palladium (Pd) hydride-based catalysts have been reported to have
        excellent performance for CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reactions
        (HER). Our previous doped-PdH and alloy hydride works showed that Ti-doped
        and Ti-alloyed Pd hydride could improve the performance of the CO2 reduction
        reaction compared to pure Pd hydride. Compositions and chemical orderings
        of the surfaces with only one adsorbate under certain reaction condition are
        linked to their stablity, activity, and selectivity towards CO2RR and HER
        in our previous work. In fact, various coverages, types, and mixture of the
        adsorbates as well as state variable such as, temperature, pressure, applied
        potential, and chemical potential could have an impact on their stability,
        activity, and selectivity. However, these factors are usually fixed at common
        values in order to reduce the complexity of structures and complexity of reaction
        conditions in most theoretical work. To address the above complexities and
        thus huge search space, a deep learning-assisted multitasking genetic algorithm
        is used to screen for PdxTi1-xHy surfaces containing multiple adsorbates for
        CO2RR under different reaction conditions in this work. The ensemble deep
        learning model can greatly speed up the structure relaxations and keep a high
        accuracy and low uncertainty of energy and forces. The multitasking genetic
        algorithm is used to simultaneously globally find stable surface structures
        at each reaction condition. Finally, 23 stable structures are screened out
        under different reaction conditions. Among them, Pd0.56Ti0.44H1.06+25%CO,

      abstract: Presently lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the dominant Li-salt
        used in commercial rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on a graphite
        anode and a 3–4 V cathode material. While LiPF6 is not the ideal Li-salt for
        every important electrolyte property, it has a uniquely suitable combination
        of properties (temperature range, passivation, conductivity, etc.) rendering
        it the overall best Li-salt for LIBs. However, this may not necessarily be
        true for other types of Li-based batteries. Indeed, next generation batteries,
        for example lithium–metal (Li–metal), lithium–oxygen (Li–O2), and lithium–sulfur
        (Li–S), require a re-evaluation of Li-salts due to the different electrochemical
        and chemical reactions and conditions within such cells. This review explores
        the critical role Li-salts play in ensuring in these batteries viability.

        of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple'for-loop'construction.
        Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed
        through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields
        using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides
        modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization,

      abstract: Electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations have shown
        that Pd-based metal hydrides can display good performance in the CO2 reduction
        reaction (CO2RR). To explore higher-performance catalysts, Pd-based alloy
        hydrides PdxM1–xHy are studied in this work. Our previous work on doped-PdH
        showed that doping Ti and Nb into PdH can improve the CO2RR activity, suggesting
        that the Pd alloy hydrides with better performance are likely to be found
        in the Pdx Ti1–xHy and PdxNb1–xHy phase space. However, the complex nature
        of the compositional and structural phase space that includes different compositions
        of alloy hydrides, different concentrations of the metal element and H of
        alloy hydrides, different adsorption sites, and different adsorbates, makes
        it intractable to screen out the stable and active PdxM1–xHy catalysts using
        density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Herein, an active learning cluster
        expansion (ALCE) surrogate model equipped with Monte Carlo simulated annealing
        (MCSA), a CO* filter and a kinetic model are used to identify promising Pdx
        Ti1–xHy and PdxNb1–xHy catalysts with high stability and superior activity.
        Finally, 24 stable and active candidates of Pdx Ti1–xHy and 6 active candidates
        of PdxNb1–xHy are found using our approach. Among them, the Pd0.23Ti0.77H,
        Pd0.19Ti0.81H0.94 and Pd0.17Nb0.83H0.25 display superior current densities

      abstract: The possibility of using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier is discussed.
        Compared to other hydrogen storage materials, ammonia has the advantages of
        a high hydrogen density, a well-developed technology for synthesis and distribution,
        and easy catalytic decomposition. Compared to hydrocarbons and alcohols, it
        has the advantage that there is no CO2 emission at the end user. The drawbacks
        are mainly the toxicity of liquid ammonia and the problems related to trace
        amounts of ammonia in the hydrogen after decomposition. Storage of ammonia
        in metal ammine salts is discussed, and it is shown that this maintains the
        high volumetric hydrogen density while alleviating the problems of handling
        the ammonia. Some of the remaining challenges for research in ammonia as a
        hydrogen carrier are outlined.

        increased hardness and yield strength. We present atomic-scale simulations
        of the plastic behavior of nanocrystalline copper. The simulations show that
        the main deformation mode is sliding in the grain boundaries through a large
        number of uncorrelated events, where a few atoms (or a few tens of atoms)
        slide with respect to each other. Little dislocation activity is seen in the
        grain interiors. The localization of the deformation to the grain boundaries
        leads to a hardening as the grain size is increased (reverse Hall-Petch effect),
        implying a maximum in hardness for a grain size above the ones studied here.

      abstract: MoTe2 has been experimentally and theoretically identified as a promising
        cathode candidate for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). A full understanding
        of its reactivity requires special consideration of the reaction kinetics,
        but this is challenging due to the varying electrode potential in the canonical
        density functional theory (DFT), which calls for grand canonical, constant
        potential methods. Here, the full reaction pathways for the CO2RR to CO and

        edge in an alkaline medium using a grand canonical ensemble DFT approach with
        a hybrid solvent model to understand the explicit effect of the applied potential.
        Our results show that the barrier of the first CO2RR step, the CO2 adsorption,
        is lower than the first HER step, the Volmer step, which implies that the
        CO2RR is favored. We also find that at more negative potentials, the first

        from 203 international venues published between 2017 and 2021, followed by
        an in-depth review of 311 papers. Based on our review, we identify five main
        topics at the intersection of XR and AI, showing how research at the intersection
        can benefit each other. Furthermore, we present a list of commonly used datasets,
        software, libraries, and models to help researchers interested in this intersection.
        Finally, we present 13 research opportunities and recommendations for future
        work in XR and AI research. '

      abstract: Advancements in display and sensor technology have led to virtual
        reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) progressing from devices mainly
        used for research purposes to everyday end user technology. The devices are
        used in a broad range of application areas, particularly for training and
        educational purposes. Such applications leverage the advantage of the devices
        of being able to create ecologically valid environments allowing us to study
        human behavior in a controlled, safe, and realistic way. Furthermore, consumer
        users are increasingly adopting the devices, anticipating their potential
        to become an integral part of our everyday device repertoire.  However, current
        VR HMDs expose users to digital eye strain (DES) - a rapidly spreading health
        problem in today's digital society. DES collectively refers to eye and vision
        problems caused by prolonged exposure to digital screens. Its non-specific
        symptoms, such as dry eyes, eye ache, or blurred vision, affect the users'
        overall quality of life and general well-being. While a large body of work
        exists on DES in conventional displays, the problem has only marginally been
        addressed in the context and development of VR HMDs - despite them carrying
        inherent properties that make them particularly prone (e.g., coverage of large
        parts of the field of view, close distance to the eyes). Besides such technical
        factors, the context of use inherently increases the problem, as the goal
        of VR experiences is usually to immerse the users in the virtual environment,
        which may lead to prolonged and extended exposures.  This dissertation lays
        the foundation for researching DES in VR HMDs by analyzing …

      abstract: Redirected walking (RDW) allows virtual reality (VR) users to walk
        infinitely while staying inside a finite physical space through subtle shifts
        (gains) of the scene to redirect them back inside the volume. All prior approaches
        measure the feasibility of RDW techniques based on if the user perceives the
        manipulation, leading to rather small applicable gains. However, we treat
        RDW as an interaction technique and therefore use visually perceivable gains
        instead of using the perception of manipulation. We revisited prior experiments
        with focus on applied gains and additionally tested higher gains on the basis
        of applicability in a user study. We found that users accept curvature gains
        up to 20°/m, which reduces the necessary physical volume down to approximately
        6x6m for virtually walking infinitely straight ahead. Our findings strife
        to rethink the usage of redirection from being unperceived to being applicable
        and natural.

      abstract: Current approaches for locomotion in virtual reality are either creating
        a visual-vestibular conflict, which is assumed to cause simulator sickness,
        or use metaphors such as teleportation to travel longer distances, lacking
        the perception of self motion. We propose VRSpinning, a seated locomotion
        approach based around stimulating the user's vestibular system using a rotational
        impulse to induce the perception of linear self-motion. In a first study we
        explored the approach of oscillating the chair in different frequencies during
        visual forward motion and collected user preferences on applying these feedback
        types. In a second user study we used short bursts of rotational acceleration
        to match the visual forward acceleration. We found that this rotational stimulus
        significantly reduced simulator sickness and increased the perception of self-motion
        in comparison to no physical motion.

      abstract: Labeling of multivariate biomedical time series data is a laborious
        and expensive process. Self-supervised contrastive learning alleviates the
        need for large, labeled datasets through pretraining on unlabeled data. However,
        for multivariate time series data the set of input channels often varies between
        applications, and most existing work does not allow for transfer between datasets
        with different sets of input channels. We propose learning one encoder to
        operate on all input channels individually. We then use a message passing
        neural network to extract a single representation across channels. We demonstrate
        the potential of this method by pretraining our network on a dataset with
        six EEG channels and finetuning on a dataset with two different EEG channels.
        We compare networks with and without the message passing neural network across
        different contrastive loss functions. We show that our method combined with
        the TS2Vec loss outperforms all other methods in most settings.

      abstract: The current study of human-machine alignment aims at understanding
        the geometry of latent spaces and the correspondence to human representations.
        G\"ardenfors' conceptual spaces is a prominent framework for understanding
        human representations. Convexity of object regions in conceptual spaces is
        argued to promote generalizability, few-shot learning, and intersubject alignment.
        Based on these insights, we investigate the notion of convexity of concept
        regions in machine-learned latent spaces. We develop a set of tools for measuring
        convexity in sampled data and evaluate emergent convexity in layered representations
        of state-of-the-art deep networks. We show that convexity is robust to basic
        re-parametrization, hence, meaningful as a quality of machine-learned latent
        spaces. We find that approximate convexity is pervasive in neural representations
        in multiple application domains, including models of images, audio, human
        activity, text, and brain data. We measure convexity separately for labels
        (i.e., targets for fine-tuning) and other concepts. Generally, we observe
        that fine-tuning increases the convexity of label regions, while for more
        general concepts, it depends on the alignment of the concept with the fine-tuning
        objective. We find evidence that pre-training convexity of class label regions
        predicts subsequent fine-tuning performance.

      abstract: International refugee law is seen by many as constitutive for national
        refugee policy. Yet, as asylum has become politicized, many countries have
        adopted procedural and physical deterrence mechanisms to prevent refugees
        from accessing protection. The present article examines these policies, as
        well as the legal responses to them, as a critical case study for understanding
        the relationship between international law and refugee policy. Based on a
        theoretical triangulation of the dominant accounts of the interplay between
        international law and politics within liberal, realist and critical legal
        studies scholarship, it is argued that the two should rather be seen in a
        dialectic process of co-evolution. This speaks both to the continued power
        of international refugee law, but also to the instrumentalist approach of
        certain states trying to contest or circumvent their international legal commitments.

        a hitherto unheard-of capacity to select, analyze and utilize the large amount
        of data that is available to us. Furthermore, a wide variety of collaborations
        harnessing modern digital technologies have been established in all segments
        of Danish society with the intent and hope to benefit both public and private
        entities in a broad sense. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that some
        of the most complex societal challenges can only be solved through interdisciplinary
        efforts, and that data science, in combination with other disciplines, has
        a huge potential to create new insights and scientific breakthroughs.Reflecting
        this, targeted funding for this type of interdisciplinary research is increasingly
        made available from both Danish and international funding bodies. In Denmark,
        eg, the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Villum Foundation had a strategic
        focus on data science and established specific funding pools for interdisciplinary
        research (eg, Villum Synergy) for several years, and in 2023, DKK 456, 1 million
        was allocated to research related to digitalization and new technologies in
        the agreement on the Danish Research Reserve (Forskningsreserven 2023). A
        similar trend exists for international research bodies, where a growing proportion

        projects combining data science and domain expertise. Over the last five years,
        large-scale grants have further enabled the establishment of dedicated hubs

      abstract: Is there still a right to seek asylum in a globalised world? Migration
        control has increasingly moved to the high seas or the territory of transit
        and origin countries, and is now commonly outsourced to private actors. Under
        threat of financial penalties airlines today reject any passenger not in possession
        of a valid visa, and private contractors are used to run detention centres
        and man border crossings. In this volume Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen examines
        the impact of these new practices for refugees' access to asylum. A systematic
        analysis is provided of the reach and limits of international refugee law
        when migration control is carried out extraterritorially or by non-state actors.
        State practice from around the globe and case law from all the major human
        rights institutions is discussed. The arguments are further linked to wider
        debates in human rights, general international law and political science.

      abstract: Asylum is a legal protection granted by a state to individuals who
        demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution or who face real risk of being
        subjected to torture in their country. However, asylum adjudication often
        depends on the decision maker's subjective assessment of the applicant's credibility.
        To investigate potential sources of bias in asylum adjudication practices
        researchers have used statistics and machine learning models, finding significant
        sources of variation with respect to a number of extra-legal variables. In
        this paper, we analyse an original dataset of Danish asylum decisions from
        the Refugee Appeals Board to understand the variables that explain Danish

      abstract: Asylum seekers and refugees continue to face serious obstacles in
        their efforts to access asylum. Some of these obstacles are inherent to irregular
        migration, including dangerous border crossings and the risk of exploitation.
        Yet, refugees also face state-made obstacles in the form of sophisticated
        migration control measures. As a result, refugees are routinely denied access
        to asylum as developed states close their borders in the hope of shifting
        the flow of asylum seekers to neighboring countries.Restrictive migration
        control policies are today the primary, some might say only, response of the
        developed world to rising numbers of asylum seekers and refugees. This has

      abstract: We present a model checking tool for Bigraphical Reactive Systems
        that may be instantiated as a model checker for any formalism or domain-specific
        modelling language encoded as a Bigraphical Reactive System. We describe the
        implementation of the tool, and how it can be used to verify correctness properties
        of some infinite-state models by applying a static analysis to reaction rules
        that permits the exclusion of some infinite branches of execution shown to
        always be free of violations. We give a proof of correctness for this method,
        and illustrate the usage of the tool with two examples --- a textbook implementation
        of the Dining Philosophers problem, and an example motivated by a ubiquitous
        computing application.

        model Dynamic Condition Response Graphs (DCR Graphs) to allow nested sub-graphs
        and a new milestone relation between events. The extension was developed during
        a case study carried out jointly with our industrial partner Exformatics,
        a danish provider of case and workflow management systems. We formalize the
        semantics by giving first a map from Nested to (flat) DCR Graphs with milestones,
        and then extending the previously given mapping from DCR Graphs to Büchi-automata
        to include the milestone relation.

      abstract: Smart contracts executed on blockchains are interactive programs where
        external actors generate events that trigger function invocations. Events
        can be emitted by participants asynchronously. However, some functionalities
        should be restricted to participants inhabiting specific roles in the system,
        which might be dynamically adjusted while the system evolves. We argue that
        current smart contract languages adopting imperative programming paradigms
        require additional complicated access control code. Furthermore, smart contracts
        are often developed independently and cannot share a joint access control
        policy. We propose to use Dynamic Condition Response Graphs for role-based
        and declarative access control for smart contracts. We show that they allow
        to capture and visualize a form of dynamic access control where access rights
        evolve as the contract state progresses. Their use supports straight-forward

        if the independent behaviour of each role in composition with other roles,

        introduce a novel choreographic language expressing safety and liveness properties,

        exploration of the structural space that correctly reflects the relative conformational
        stabilities. Here, we present a fully probabilistic, continuous model of local
        protein structure in atomic detail. The generative model makes efficient conformational
        sampling possible and provides a framework for the rigorous analysis of local
        sequence–structure correlations in the native state. Our method represents
        a significant theoretical and practical improvement over the widely used fragment
        assembly technique by avoiding the drawbacks associated with a discrete and

        of Cα atoms in two half spheres around a residue's Cα atom. Conceptually,

      abstract: Deep learning developers typically rely on deep learning software
        frameworks (DLSFs)—simply described as pre-packaged libraries of programming
        components that provide high-level access to deep learning functionality.
        New DLSFs progressively encapsulate mathematical, statistical and computational
        complexity. Such higher levels of abstraction subsequently make it easier
        for deep learning methodology to spread through mimesis (i.e., imitation of
        models perceived as successful). In this study, we quantify this increase
        in abstraction and discuss its implications. Analyzing publicly available

        with significant increases in the number of deep learning projects and substantial

      abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) \citep{DBLP:conf/nips/LiuW16}
        is a particle-based technique for Bayesian inference. SVGD has recently gained
        popularity because it combines the ability of variational inference to handle
        tall data with the modeling power of non-parametric inference. Unfortunately,
        the number of particles required to represent a model adequately grows exponentially
        with the dimensionality of the model. Stein mixtures \citep{nalisnick2017variational}
        alleviate the exponential growth in particles by letting each particle parameterize
        a distribution. However, the inference algorithm proposed by \cite{nalisnick2017variational}
        can be numerically unstable.  We show that their algorithm corresponds to
        inference with the R\'enyi -divergence for  and that using other values for  can
        lead to more stable inference. We empirically study the performance of Stein
        mixtures inferred with different  values on various real-world problems, demonstrating
        significantly improved results when using , which coincides with using the
        evidence lower bound (ELBO). We call this instance of our algorithm ELBO-within-Stein.
        A black-box version of the inference algorithm (for arbitrary $\alpha\in \sR$)
        is available in the deep probabilistic programming language NumPyro \citep{phan2019}.

        conflicts in the evidence entered into the network, determining optimal strategies,
        analyzing for relevance, and performing sensitivity analysis.The book introduces
        probabilistic graphical models and decision graphs, including Bayesian networks

      abstract: This paper considers a parallel algorithm for Bayesian network structure
        learning from large data sets. The parallel algorithm is a variant of the
        well known PC algorithm. The PC algorithm is a constraint-based algorithm
        consisting of five steps where the first step is to perform a set of (conditional)
        independence tests while the remaining four steps relate to identifying the
        structure of the Bayesian network using the results of the (conditional) independence
        tests. In this paper, we describe a new approach to parallelization of the
        (conditional) independence testing as experiments illustrate that this is
        by far the most time consuming step. The proposed parallel PC algorithm is
        evaluated on data sets generated at random from five different real-world
        Bayesian networks. The algorithm is also compared empirically with a process-based
        approach where each process manages a subset of the data over all the variables

      abstract: In recent years, mobile network operators are showing interest in
        reducing energy consumption. Toward this goal, in cooperation with the Danish
        company 2Operate we have developed a stochastic simulation environment for
        mobile networks. Our simulator interacts with historical data from 2Operate
        and allow us to turn on and off network cells, replay traffic loads, etc.
        We have developed an optimization tool which is based on stochastic and distributed
        controllers computed by \uppaal. We have conducted experiments in our simulation
        tool. Experiments show that there is a potential to save up to 10\% of energy.
        We observe that for larger networks, there exists a larger potential for saving
        energy. Our simulator and \uppaal controllers, have been constructed in accordance
        to the 2Operate data and infrastructure. However, a main difference is that
        current equipment do not support updating schedulers on hourly bases. Nevertheless,
        new equipment e.g. new Huawei equipment do support changing schedulers on
        hourly basis. Therefore, integrating our solution in the production server
        of 2Operate is possible. However, rigorous testing in the production system
        is required.

      abstract: Classification problems have a long history in the machine learning
        literature. One of the simplest, and yet most consistently well-performing
        set of classifiers is the Naïve Bayes models. However, an inherent problem
        with these classifiers is the assumption that all attributes used to describe
        an instance are conditionally independent given the class of that instance.
        When this assumption is violated (which is often the case in practice) it
        can reduce classification accuracy due to “information double-counting” and
        interaction omission.In this paper we focus on a relatively new set of models,
        termed Hierarchical Naïve Bayes models. Hierarchical Naïve Bayes models extend
        the modeling flexibility of Naïve Bayes models by introducing latent variables
        to relax some of the independence statements in these models. We propose a
        simple algorithm for learning Hierarchical Naïve Bayes models in the context

      abstract: Since the 1980s, Bayesian networks (BNs) have become increasingly
        popular for building statistical models of complex systems. This is particularly
        true for boolean systems, where BNs often prove to be a more efficient modelling
        framework than traditional reliability techniques (like fault trees and reliability
        block diagrams). However, limitations in the BNs’ calculation engine have
        prevented BNs from becoming equally popular for domains containing mixtures
        of both discrete and continuous variables (the so-called hybrid domains).
        In this paper we focus on these difficulties, and summarize some of the last
        decade's research on inference in hybrid Bayesian networks. The discussions
        are linked to an example model for estimating human reliability.

      abstract: 'Influence diagrams serve as a powerful tool for modelling symmetric
        decision problems. When solving an influence diagram we determine a set of
        strategies for the decisions involved. A strategy for a decision variable
        is in principle a function over its past. However, some of the past may be
        irrelevant for the decision, and for computational reasons it is important
        not to deal with redundant variables in the strategies. We show that current
        methods (e.g. the "Decision Bayes-ball" algorithm by Shachter UAI98) do not
        determine the relevant past, and we present a complete algorithm. Actually,
        this paper takes a more general outset: When formulating a decision scenario
        as an influence diagram, a linear temporal ordering of the decisions variables
        is required. This constraint ensures that the decision scenario is welldefined.
        However, the structure of a decision scenario often yields certain decisions
        conditionally independent, and it is therefore unnecessary to impose a linear
        temporal ordering on the decisions. In this paper we deal with partial influence
        diagrams i.e. influence diagrams with only a partial temporal ordering specified.
        We present a set of conditions which are necessary and sufficient to ensure
        that a partial influence diagram is welldefined. These conditions are used
        as a basis for the construction of an algorithm for determining whether or
        not a partial influence diagram is welldefined.'

      abstract: Current state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning only utilize
        local features for the individual DNA sequences (contigs), neglecting additional
        information such as the assembly graph, in which the contigs are connected
        according to overlapping reads, and gene markers identified in the contigs.
        In this paper, we propose the use of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) tailored
        to leverage auxiliary structural information about contig relations when learning
        contig representations for subsequent metagenomic binning. Our method, CCVAE,
        improves on previous work that used VAEs for learning latent representations
        of the individual contigs, by constraining these representations according
        to the connectivity information from the assembly graph. Additionally, we
        incorporate into the model additional information in the form of marker genes
        to better differentiate contigs from different genomes. Our experiments on
        both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CCVAE outperforms
        current state-of-the-art techniques, thus providing a more effective method
        for metagenomic binning.

      abstract: The declarative-procedural dichotomy is highly relevant when choosing
        the most suitable process modeling language to represent a discovered process.
        Less-structured processes with a high level of variability can be described
        in a more compact way using a declarative language. By contrast, procedural
        process modeling languages seem more suitable to describe structured and stable
        processes. However, in various cases, a process may incorporate parts that
        are better captured in a declarative fashion, while other parts are more suitable
        to be described procedurally. In this paper, we present a technique for discovering
        from an event log a so-called hybrid process model. A hybrid process model
        is hierarchical, where each of its sub-processes may be specified in a declarative
        or procedural fashion. We have implemented the proposed approach as a plug-in
        of the ProM platform. To evaluate the …

      abstract: Choreographic models express coordination between business roles,

        if the independent behaviour of each role in composition with other roles,
        only behaves exactly in the same way as described in the choreography. We

        incorporating multi-perspective constraints in communication flows, data,
        and time. This language builds upon recent developments in declarative choreographies
        using the Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) graph formalism and extends it
        to accommodate data and time. The interaction between multiple dimensions
        can render models unrealizable, so we determine the conditions required for
        realizability through causal relationships …

        business processes. While several metrics have been suggested in the literature
        to evaluate the complexity of imperative process models, little is known about
        their declarative counterparts. In this paper, we address this gap through

        as measured by the suggested metrics, on users’ cognitive load when comprehending

        eye-tracking and electrodermal activity. The findings of the empirical study
        provide evidence about the cognitive load emerging as a result of increased
        model complexity. Overall, the outcome of this paper presents empirically

        resulting in the development of several academic declarative modeling techniques
        and tools. The absence of empirical evaluations on their use and usefulness,
        however, raises the question whether practitioners are attracted to using
        those techniques. In this paper, we present a study on what practitioners
        think of declarative modeling. We show that the practitioners we involved
        in this study are receptive to the idea of a hybrid approach combining imperative
        and declarative techniques, rather than making a full shift from the imperative
        to the declarative paradigm. Moreover, we report on requirements, use cases,
        limitations, and tool support of such a hybrid approach. Based on the gained
        insight, we propose a research agenda for the development of this novel modeling
        approach.

        mechanism. Nevertheless, incidences of bee stings have been on the rise since
        the accidental release of Africanized bees to Brazil in 1956 and their subsequent
        spread across the Americas. These bee hybrids are more aggressive and are
        prone to attack, presenting a significant healthcare burden to the countries
        they have colonized. To date, treatment of such stings typically focuses on
        controlling potential allergic reactions, as no specific antivenoms against
        bee venom currently exist. Researchers have investigated the possibility of
        developing bee antivenoms, but this has been complicated by the very low immunogenicity
        of the key bee toxins, which fail to induce a strong antibody response in
        the immunized animals. However, with current cutting-edge technologies, such
        as phage display, alongside the rise of monoclonal antibody therapeutics,
        the development of a recombinant bee antivenom is achievable, and promising
        results towards this goal have been reported in recent years. Here, current
        knowledge on the venom biology of Africanized bees and current treatment options
        against bee envenoming are reviewed. Additionally, recent developments within
        next-generation bee antivenoms are presented and discussed.

      abstract: Gastrointestinal helminth parasites share their habitat with a myriad
        of other organisms, that is, the commensal microbiota. Increasing evidence,
        particularly in humans and rodent models of helminth infection, points towards
        a multitude of interactions occurring between parasites and the gut microbiota,
        with a profound impact on both host immunity and metabolic potential. Despite
        this information, the exploration of the effects that parasite infections
        exert on populations of commensal gut microbes of veterinary species is a
        field of research in its infancy. In this article, we summarise studies that
        have contributed to current knowledge of helminth–microbiota interactions
        in species of veterinary interest, and identify possible avenues for future
        research in this area, which could include the exploitation of such relationships
        to improve parasite control and delay or prevent the development of anthelmintic
        resistance.

      abstract: Snakebite envenoming is a global public health issue that causes significant
        morbidity and mortality, particularly in low-income regions of the world.
        The clinical manifestations of envenomings vary depending on the snake’s venom,
        with paralysis, haemorrhage, and necrosis being the most common and medically
        relevant effects. To assess the efficacy of antivenoms against dermonecrosis,
        a preclinical testing approach involves in vivo mouse models that mimic local
        tissue effects of cytotoxic snakebites in humans. However, current methods
        for assessing necrosis severity are time-consuming and susceptible to human
        error. To address this, we present the Venom Induced Dermonecrosis Analysis
        tool (VIDAL), a machine-learning-guided image-based solution that can automatically
        identify dermonecrotic lesions in mice, adjust for lighting biases, scale
        the image, extract lesion area and discolouration, and calculate the severity
        of dermonecrosis. We also introduce a new unit, the dermonecrotic unit (DnU),
        to better capture the complexity of dermonecrosis severity. Our tool is comparable
        to the performance of state-of-the-art histopathological analysis, making
        it an accessible, accurate, and reproducible method for assessing dermonecrosis.
        Given the urgent need to address the neglected tropical disease that is snakebite,
        high-throughput technologies such as VIDAL are crucial in developing and validating
        new and existing therapeutics for this debilitating disease.

      abstract: Investigations of the impact that patent infections by soil-transmitted
        gastrointestinal nematode parasites exert on the composition of the host gut
        commensal flora are attracting growing interest by the scientific community.
        However, information collected to date varies across experiments, and further
        studies are needed to identify consistent relationships between parasites
        and commensal microbial species. Here, we explore the qualitative and quantitative
        differences between the microbial community profiles of cohorts of human volunteers
        from Sri Lanka with patent infection by one or more parasitic nematode species
        (H+), as well as that of uninfected subjects (H-) and of volunteers who had
        been subjected to regular prophylactic anthelmintic treatment (Ht). High-throughput
        sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, followed by bioinformatics and
        biostatistical analyses of sequence data revealed no significant differences
        in alpha diversity (Shannon) and richness between groups (P = 0.65, P = 0.13
        respectively); however, beta diversity was significantly increased in H+ and
        Ht when individually compared to H-volunteers (P = 0.04). Among others, bacteria
        of the families Verrucomicrobiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae showed a trend
        towards increased abundance in H+, whereas the Leuconostocaceae and Bacteroidaceae
        showed a relative increase in H- and Ht respectively. Our findings add valuable

        associated with the development of several inflammatory diseases. Recent reports
        in humans and animal models have demonstrated the beneficial therapeutic effects

        such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and coeliac disease (CeD). Interestingly,
        these studies have described how helminths may alter the intestinal microbiota,
        potentially representing a mechanism by which they regulate inflammation.
        However, for practical reasons, these reports have primarily analysed the

      abstract: Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where,
        remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding
        of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes
        and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence
        species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications
        for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted
        that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial
        extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10
        km2 to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review
        we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions
        beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions
        into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary

      abstract: Holarctic species offer great opportunities to study biogeography,
        phylogenetics, taxonomy, and local adaptation. Species that are considered
        conspecific between the Palearctic and the Nearctic realms are often split
        into 2 or more species when denser sampling and molecular markers are applied.
        Similar in complexity but at a finer geographical scale are species groups
        having Arctic-Alpine distributions where lineages have complicated demographic
        histories due to glacial dynamics. In both cases, allopatric speciation might
        not result in fast differentiation of morphological characters if environmental

      abstract: The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average, and
        plant communities are responding through shifts in species abundance, composition
        and distribution. However, the direction and magnitude of local plant diversity
        changes have not been explored thus far at a pan-Arctic scale. Using a compilation
        of 42,234 records of 490 vascular plant species from 2,174 plots at 45 study
        areas across the Arctic, we quantified how species richness and composition
        have changed over time during a period of up to four decades (1981 – 2022),
        and identified the geographic, climatic and biotic drivers behind these changes.
        Despite plant species richness being greater at lower latitudes and warmer
        plots, pan-Arctic species richness did not change directionally over time
        at the plot level. However, 99% of the plots experienced changes in species
        abundance, with 66% of plots either gaining or losing species. Species richness
        increased most where temperatures had warmed most over time, and shrub expansion
        led to greater species losses and decreasing richness. Yet, Arctic plant communities
        did not become more similar to each other over time, suggesting that no biotic
        homogenisation has occurred thus far. Overall, we found that Arctic plots
        changed in richness and composition in all possible directions, yet climate
        and biotic interactions still emerged as the main drivers of directional change.
        Our results show a variety of diversity trends, which could be precursors
        of future changes for Arctic plant biodiversity, ecosystem function, wildlife
        habitats and livelihoods for Arctic Communities.

        can desynchronise ecological interactions and thereby threaten ecosystem function.
        To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change

        Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets,
        spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation
        in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity
        varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite

      abstract: With the global change in climate, the Arctic has been pinpointed
        as the region experiencing the fastest rates of change. As a result, Arctic
        biological responses—such as shifts in phenology—are expected to outpace those
        at lower latitudes. 15 years ago, a decade-long dataset from Zackenberg in
        High Arctic Greenland revealed rapid rates of phenological change.1 To explore
        how the timing of spring phenology has developed since, we revisit the Zackenberg
        time series on flowering plants, arthropods, and birds. Drawing on the full
        25-year period of 1996–2020, we find little directional change in the timing
        of events despite ongoing climatic change. We attribute this finding to a
        shift in the temporal patterns of climate conditions, from previous directional
        change to current high inter-annual variability. Additionally, some taxa appear

      abstract: Climate change is altering the phenology of species across the world,
        but what are the consequences of these phenological changes for the demography
        and population dynamics of species? Time-sensitive relationships, such as
        migration, breeding and predation, may be disrupted or altered, which may
        in turn alter the rates of reproduction and survival, leading some populations
        to decline and others to increase in abundance. However, finding evidence
        for disrupted relationships, or lack thereof, and their demographic effects,
        is difficult because the necessary detailed observational data are rare. Moreover,

      abstract: Despite uncertainties in the magnitude of expected global warming
        over the next century, one consistent feature of extant and projected changes
        is that Arctic environments are and will be exposed to the greatest warming
        [1]. Concomitant with such large abiotic changes, biological responses to
        warming at high northern latitudes are also expected to outpace those at lower
        latitudes. One of the clearest and most rapid signals of biological response
        to rising temperatures across an array of biomes has been shifts in species
        phenology [2–4], yet to date evidence for phenological responses to climate
        change has been presented from most biomes except the High Arctic [3]. Given
        the well-established consequences for population dynamics of shifts in the
        timing of life history events [5,6], it is essential that the High Arctic
        be represented in assessments of phenological response to climate change.

      abstract: DC power systems are gaining an increasing interest in renewable energy
        applications because of the good matching with dc output type sources such
        as photovoltaic (PV) systems and secondary batteries. In this paper, several
        distributed generators (DGs) have been merged together with a pair of batteries
        and loads to form an autonomous dc microgrid (MG). To overcome the control
        challenge associated with coordination of multiple batteries within one stand-alone
        MG, a double-layer hierarchical control strategy was proposed. 1) The unit-level
        primary control layer was established by an adaptive voltage-droop method
        aimed to regulate the common bus voltage and to sustain the states of charge
        (SOCs) of batteries close to each other during moderate replenishment. The

      abstract: DC microgrids (MGs) have been gaining a continually increasing interest
        over the past couple of years both in academia and industry. The advantages
        of dc distribution when compared to its ac counterpart are well known. The
        most important ones include higher reliability and efficiency, simpler control
        and natural interface with renewable energy sources, and electronic loads
        and energy storage systems. With rapid emergence of these components in modern
        power systems, the importance of dc in today's society is gradually being
        brought to a whole new level. A broad class of traditional dc distribution
        applications, such as traction, telecom, vehicular, and distributed power
        systems can be classified under dc MG framework and ongoing development, and
        expansion of the field is largely influenced by concepts used over there.

      abstract: This paper presents a distributed hierarchical control framework to
        ensure reliable operation of dc microgrid (MG) clusters. In this hierarchy,
        primary control is used to regulate the common bus voltage inside each MG
        locally. An adaptive droop method is proposed for this level, which determines
        droop coefficients according to the state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries automatically.
        A small-signal model is developed to investigate effects of the system parameters,
        constant power loads, as well as line impedance between the MGs on stability
        of these systems. In the secondary level, a distributed consensus-based voltage
        regulator is introduced to eliminate the average voltage deviation over the
        MGs. This distributed averaging method allows the power flow control between
        the MGs to be achieved at the same time, as it can be accomplished only at
        the cost of having voltage deviation inside the system. Another distributed

      abstract: Accurate lifetime prediction of transformers operated in power grids
        with renewable energy systems is a challenging task because it requires a
        large amount of data that is not usually available. In the case of wind energy,
        this complexity is intensified with the stochastic ageing process influenced
        by the intermittency of the wind and weather conditions. Existing models make
        use of detailed power topologies to evaluate transformer stress profiles and

        of future electric distribution grids. In order to adapt to this new and revolutionary
        paradigm, it is necessary to control MGs in intelligent and coordinated fashion.

      abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a prominent solution for
        medium- to high-voltage and high-power conversion applications. Recently,
        distributed control strategies have been proposed to make this converter modular
        in terms of software and control hardware. In this control architecture, high-level
        control tasks are performed by a central controller (CC), whereas low-level
        control tasks are achieved by local controllers (LCs) placed on the MMC submodules.
        The CC and LCs use a cyber-physical system (CPS) to share all the necessary
        information to execute their respective control schemes. In this context,
        the CPS is vulnerable to cyberattacks, such as the false data injection attack
        (FDIA), where the data seen by the controllers are corrupted through illegitimate
        data intrusion. This cyberattack may hinder the MMC performance, producing
        suboptimal, or even unstable operations. Even more, diverse FDIAs …

      abstract: This paper presents a review of control strategies, stability analysis,
        and stabilization techniques for dc microgrids (MGs). Overall control is systematically
        classified into local and coordinated control levels according to respective
        functionalities in each level. As opposed to local control, which relies only
        on local measurements, some line of communication between units needs to be
        made available in order to achieve the coordinated control. Depending on the
        communication method, three basic coordinated control strategies can be distinguished,
        i.e., decentralized, centralized, and distributed control. Decentralized control
        can be regarded as an extension of the local control since it is also based
        exclusively on local measurements. In contrast, centralized and distributed
        control strategies rely on digital communication technologies. A number of
        approaches using these three coordinated control strategies to achieve …

        (OBMG) systems for transportation applications. Energy management strategies
        (EMS) for OBMG systems require complicated optimization algorithms and high
        computation capabilities, while traditional control techniques may not meet
        these requirements. Driven by the ability to achieve intelligent decision-making
        by exploring data, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twins (DT) have

        on EMS for OBMGs primarily focuses on AI technology, while overlooking the

      abstract: Mid-air haptic stimulation can enrich user experience during human-computer
        interaction. However, the design space of such stimuli is large due to the
        number and range of stimulation parameters. It therefore remains difficult
        for designers to select a stimulus to induce an intended experience. We derive
        a mapping for mid-air experiences based on two user studies. In the first
        study, participants rated 36 stimuli varied across three parameters (frequency,
        pattern, and repetitions). These ratings allowed us to determine a set of
        five experientially distinct stimuli. In the second study, participants vocalized
        their experiences with those five stimuli. This allows us to generate a mapping
        of 17 sensations and 23 experiences related to the stimuli. Finally, we discuss
        how the mapping can inform designers and researchers working with mid-air
        haptic technologies.

        for improving evaluation methods and offer ideas for how to make studies more

      abstract: ' Technological advances are enabling a new class of augmented reality
        (AR) applications that use bodies as substrates for input and output. In contrast
        to sensing and augmenting objects, body-based AR applications track people
        around the user and layer information on them. However, prototyping such applications
        is complex, time-consuming, and cumbersome, due to a lack of easily accessible
        tooling and infrastructure. We present Body LayARs, a toolkit for fast development
        of body-based AR prototypes. Instead of directly programming for a device,
        Body LayARs provides an extensible graphical programming environment with
        a device-independent runtime abstraction. We focus on face-based experiences

      abstract: Term-Relevance Prediction from Brain Signals (TRPB) is proposed to
        automatically detect relevance of text information directly from brain signals.
        An experiment with forty participants was conducted to record neural activity
        of participants while providing relevance judgments to text stimuli for a
        given topic. High-precision scientific equipment was used to quantify neural
        activity across 32 electroencephalography (EEG) channels. A classifier based
        on a multi-view EEG feature representation showed improvement up to 17% in
        relevance prediction based on brain signals alone. Relevance was also associated
        with brain activity with significant changes in certain brain areas. Consequently,
        TRPB is based on changes identified in specific brain areas and does not require
        user-specific training or calibration. Hence, relevance predictions can be
        conducted for unseen content and unseen participants. As an application of

      abstract: Visual recognition requires inferring the similarity between a perceived
        object and a mental target. However, a measure of similarity is difficult
        to determine when it comes to complex stimuli such as faces. Indeed, people
        may notice someone “looks like” a familiar face, but find it hard to describe
        on the basis of what features such a comparison is based. Previous work shows
        that the number of similar visual elements between a face pictogram and a
        memorized target correlates with the P300 amplitude in the visual evoked potential.
        Here, we redefine similarity as the distance inferred from a latent space
        learned using a state‐of‐the‐art generative adversarial neural network (GAN).
        A rapid serial visual presentation experiment was conducted with oddball images
        generated at varying distances from the target to determine how P300 amplitude
        related to GAN‐derived distances. The results showed that distance‐to …

      abstract: Affective annotation refers to the process of labeling media content
        based on the emotions they evoke. Since such experiences are inherently subjective
        and depend on individual differences, the central challenge is associating

        used to draw predictions about the affective dimensions that characterize
        the stimuli. By combining annotations, the results show that monitoring crowd

      abstract: This paper discusses the design, simulation and construction of a
        bending-active textile hybrid structure commissioned to the authors as part
        of the 2018 Venice Biennale. The hybrid structure combines the flexibility
        and elastic properties of GFRP rods together with bespoke CNC knitted fabric,
        creating a subtle equilibrium of forces along the unfolding of the installation.
        Building on the knowledge developed by the authors on previous bending-active
        hybrid prototypes, the structure represents the latest effort in terms of
        integration of design analysis tools within a holistic and comprehensive workflow.
        This enables designers to step fluently from initial concept development and
        definition of overall shape to the final specification of the knitted membrane
        structure on loop level for digital fabrication. With particular emphasis
        on the simulation tools employed, the paper will focus on the most up-to-date
        computational technologies and numerical approaches that are currently being
        developed for the design and analysis of bending-active and textile hybrid
        structures. Specifically, three distinct environments were used to form-find
        and analyse the structural behaviour of the installation, these environments
        being Kangaroo (vector-based approach), Kiwi3d (Isogeometric Analysis) and
        SOFiSTiK (Finite Element Analysis). This all-encompassing approach provided
        the perfect platform to cross-benchmark the three different methods, highlighting
        the qualities of each one and providing valuable information on the most appropriate
        software within a certain stage of design.

        development and can contribute to monitoring and mitigating humanitarian problems.
        The potential of applying novel technologies to solving some of humanity's
        most pressing issues has garnered interest outside the traditional disciplines
        studying and working on international development. Today, scientific communities
        in fields like Computational Social Science, Network Science, Complex Systems,
        Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, and the broader AI field are
        increasingly starting to pay attention to these pressing issues. However,
        are sophisticated data driven tools ready to be used for solving real-world
        problems with imperfect data and of staggering complexity? We outline the
        current state-of-the-art and identify barriers, which need to be surmounted
        in order for data-driven technologies to become useful in humanitarian and
        development contexts. We argue that, without organized and purposeful efforts,
        these new technologies risk at best falling short of promised goals, at worst
        they can increase inequality, amplify discrimination, and infringe upon human
        rights.

        work. This is particularly evident in top multidisciplinary journals, where
        a scientist is unlikely to appear as senior author if he or she has not previously

        of author order by quantifying this “chaperone effect,” capturing how scientists
        transition into senior status within a particular publication venue. We illustrate
        that the chaperone effect has a different magnitude for journals in different
        branches of science, being more pronounced in medical and biological sciences
        and weaker in natural sciences. Finally, we show that in the case of high-impact

        in a higher average impact relative to papers authored by new principal investigators
        (PIs). Our findings shed light on the role played by experience in …

      abstract: Understanding how people interact and socialize is important in many
        contexts from disease control to urban planning. Datasets that capture this
        specific aspect of human life have increased in size and availability over
        the last few years. We have yet to understand, however, to what extent such
        electronic datasets may serve as a valid proxy for real life social interactions.
        For an observational dataset, gathered using mobile phones, we analyze the
        problem of identifying transient and non-important links, as well as how to
        highlight important social interactions. Applying the Bluetooth signal strength
        parameter to distinguish between observations, we demonstrate that weak links,
        compared to strong links, have a lower probability of being observed at later
        times, while such links—on average—also have lower link-weights and probability
        of sharing an online friendship. Further, the role of link-strength is investigated
        in relation to social network properties.

      abstract: Ensuring transparency and integrity in political communication on
        climate change has arguably never been more important than today. Yet we know
        little about how politicians focus on, talk about, and portray climate change
        on social media. Here we study it from the perspective of political advertisement.
        We use Meta’s Ad Library to collect 602,546 ads that have been issued by US
        Congress members since mid-2018. Out of those only 19,176 (3.2%) are climate-related.
        Analyzing this data, we find that Democrats focus substantially more on climate
        change than Republicans, with 99.7% of all climate-related ads stemming from
        Democratic politicians. In particular, we find this is driven by a small core
        of Democratic politicians, where 72% of all impressions can be attributed
        to 10 politicians. Interestingly, we find a significant difference in the
        average amount of impressions generated per dollar spent between the two parties.
        Republicans generate on average 188% more impressions with their climate ads
        for the same money spent as Democrats. We build models to explain the differences
        and find that demographic factors only partially explain the variance. Our
        results demonstrate differences of climate-related advertisements of US congress
        members and reveal differences in advertising characteristics between the
        two political parties. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for further
        studies about climate-related ads on Meta’s platforms.

      abstract: Recent seminal works on human mobility have shown that individuals
        constantly exploit a small set of repeatedly visited locations–. A concurrent
        study has emphasized the explorative nature of human behaviour, showing that
        the number of visited places grows steadily over time–. How to reconcile these
        seemingly contradicting facts remains an open question. Here, we analyse high-resolution
        multi-year traces of ~40,000 individuals from 4 datasets and show that this
        tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility patterns is considered.
        We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly yet smoothly, and that
        the number of familiar locations an individual visits at any point is a conserved
        quantity with a typical size of ~25. We use this finding to improve state-of-the-art
        modelling of human mobility,. Furthermore, shifting the attention from aggregated
        quantities to individual behaviour, we show that the size …

      abstract: We provide a brief review of human mobility science and present three
        key areas where we expect to see substantial advancements. We start from the
        mind and discuss the need to better understand how spatial cognition shapes
        mobility patterns. We then move to societies and argue the importance of better
        understanding new forms of transportation. We conclude by discussing how algorithms
        shape mobility behavior and provide useful tools for modelers. Finally, we
        discuss how progress on these research directions may help us address some
        of the challenges our society faces today.

      abstract: Large-scale human mobility data is a key resource in data-driven policy
        making and across many scientific fields. Most recently, mobility data was
        extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic to study the effects of governmental
        policies and to inform epidemic models. Large-scale mobility is often measured
        using digital tools such as mobile phones. However, it remains an open question
        how truthfully these digital proxies represent the actual travel behavior
        of the general population. Here, we examine mobility datasets from multiple
        countries and identify two fundamentally different types of bias caused by
        unequal access to, and unequal usage of mobile phones. We introduce the concept
        of data generation bias, a previously overlooked type of bias, which is present
        when the amount of data that an individual produces influences their representation
        in the dataset. We find evidence for data generation bias in all examined
        datasets in that high-wealth individuals are overrepresented, with the richest
        20% contributing over 50% of all recorded trips, substantially skewing the
        datasets. This inequality is consequential, as we find mobility patterns of
        different wealth groups to be structurally different, where the mobility networks
        of high-wealth users are denser and contain more long-range connections. To
        mitigate the skew, we present a framework to debias data and show how simple
        techniques can be used to increase representativeness. Using our approach
        we show how biases can severely impact outcomes of dynamic processes such
        as epidemic simulations, where biased data incorrectly estimates the severity
        and speed of disease transmission …

      abstract: Social systems are in a constant state of flux, with dynamics spanning
        from minute-by-minute changes to patterns present on the timescale of years.
        Accurate models of social dynamics are important for understanding the spreading
        of influence or diseases, formation of friendships, and the productivity of
        teams. Although there has been much progress on understanding complex networks
        over the past decade, little is known about the regularities governing the
        microdynamics of social networks. Here, we explore the dynamic social network
        of a densely-connected population of ∼1,000 individuals and their interactions
        in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured via Bluetooth,
        as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media contacts,
        geolocation, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow us to
        observe social groups directly, rendering community detection …

      abstract: We present the first experimental observation and quantification of
        the evolution of the three-dimensional (3D) deflection of fibres leading up
        to kink-band formation in notched unidirectional glass fibre-epoxy composites.
        This has been achieved by in situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (CT)
        quantified by advanced image analysis. The 3D trajectories of individual fibres
        were extracted to monitor the change in fibre profiles with increasing compressive
        load. Initially the fibre trajectory varies significantly from fibre to fibre,
        the waviness of which cannot be represented by a simple idealised profile.
        However, the change in the fibre shapes during axial compression is similar
        for all fibres, as the fibres deflect towards the final kinking direction.
        The precursor to kink-band nucleation has been identified as a local tilting
        of fibres in the region where the kink bands ultimately form, defining a micro-buckle
        band. Even at …

      abstract: Progress in 3D volumetric image analysis research is limited by the
        lack of datasets and most advances in analysis methods for volumetric images
        are based on medical data. However, medical data do not necessarily resemble
        the characteristics of other volumetric images such as micro-CT. To promote
        research in 3D volumetric image analysis beyond medical data, we have created
        the BugNIST dataset and made it freely available. BugNIST is an extensive
        dataset of micro-CT scans of 12 types of bugs, such as insects and larvae.
        BugNIST contains 9437 volumes where 9087 are of individual bugs and 350 are
        mixtures of bugs and other material. The goal of BugNIST is to benchmark classification
        and detection methods, and we have designed the detection challenge such that
        detection models are trained on scans of individual bugs and tested on bug
        mixtures. Models capable of solving this task will be independent of the context,
        i.e., the surrounding material. This is a great advantage if the context is
        unknown or changing, as is often the case in micro-CT. Our initial baseline
        analysis shows that current state-of-the-art deep learning methods classify
        individual bugs very well, but has great difficulty with the detection challenge.
        Hereby, BugNIST enables research in image analysis areas that until now have
        missed relevant data - both classification, detection, and hopefully more.

      abstract: This dataset includes four large field-of-view scanning electron microscopy
        (SEM) images together with associated Matlab scripts aimed for the analysis
        used in the joint publication. Each of the four stitched images is generated
        from a large number (between 15500 and 24500) high-resolution (195nm/pixel)
        scans, which have been stitched into four images stored as tiff-files. The
        images show the cross-section of fiber bundles in composite laminate and are
        well-suited for local fiber volume determination. The image resolution corresponds
        to between 600 and 2000 pixels covering each fiber. The imaged samples are
        from composite laminates with an overall fiber volume fraction in the range
        of 55% to 60%. The local fiber volume fraction is found both for the full
        cross-section, as an average fiber volume fraction over the individual bundles,
        and as a local fiber volume fraction found in a moving averaging box with
        a size …

      abstract: The sudden compressive failure of unidirectional (UD) fibre reinforced
        composites at loads well below their tensile strengths is a cause of practical
        concern. In this respect and more generally, analytical and numerical models
        that describe composite behaviour have been hard to verify due to a lack of
        experimental observation, particularly in 3D. The aim of this paper is to
        combine fast in-situ X-ray computed tomography (CT) with advanced image analysis
        to capture the changes in fibre orientation in 3D during uninterrupted progressive
        loading in compression of a UD glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP). By analysing
        and establishing correspondence between a sequence of time-lapse X-ray CT
        images of the composite, we are able for the first time to follow each fibre
        and quantify the progressive deflection that takes place during axial compression
        in the steps leading up to fibre micro-buckling and kinking. Even at …

      abstract: Axonal conduction velocity, which ensures efficient function of the
        brain network, is related to axon diameter. Noninvasive, in vivo axon diameter
        estimates can be made with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, but the technique
        requires three-dimensional (3D) validation. Here, high-resolution, 3D synchrotron
        X-ray nano-holotomography images of white matter samples from the corpus callosum
        of a monkey brain reveal that blood vessels, cells, and vacuoles affect axonal
        diameter and trajectory. Within single axons, we find that the variation in
        diameter and conduction velocity correlates with the mean diameter, contesting
        the value of precise diameter determination in larger axons. These complex
        3D axon morphologies drive previously reported 2D trends in axon diameter
        and g-ratio. Furthermore, we find that these morphologies bias the estimates
        of axon diameter with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging …

      abstract: 'Purpose: Optic disc drusen (ODD) are found in up to 2.4% of the population
        and are known to cause visual field defects. The purpose of the current study
        was to investigate how quantitatively estimated volume and anatomic location
        of ODD influence optic nerve function.Methods: Anatomic location, volume of
        ODD, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macular ganglion cell
        layer thickness were assessed in 37 ODD patients using enhanced depth imaging
        optical coherence tomography. Volume of ODD was calculated by manual segmentation
        of ODD in 97 B-scans per eye. Anatomic characteristics were compared with
        optic nerve function using automated perimetric mean deviation (MD) and multifocal
        visual evoked potentials.Results: Increased age (P= 0.015); larger ODD volume
        (P= 0.002); and more superficial anatomic ODD location (P= 0.007) were found
        in patients with ODD visible by ophthalmoscopy compared to patients with buried
        ODD. In a multivariate analysis, a worsening of MD was significantly associated
        with larger ODD volume (P< 0.0001). No association was found between MD and
        weighted anatomic location, age, and visibility by ophthalmoscopy. Decreased
        ganglion cell layer thickness was significantly associated with worse MD (P=
        0.025) and had a higher effect on MD when compared to retinal nerve fiber
        layer thickness.Conclusions: Large ODD volume is associated with optic nerve
        dysfunction. The worse visual field defects associated with visible ODD should
        only be ascribed to larger ODD volume and not to a more superficial anatomic
        ODD location.'

      abstract: Imaging with X-ray computed tomography (CT) enables non-destructive
        3D characterisations of the micro-structure inside fibre composites. In this
        paper we validate the use of X-ray CT coupled with image analysis for characterising
        unidirectional (UD) fibre composites. We compare X-ray CT at different resolutions
        to optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), where we
        characterise fibres by their diameters and positions. In addition to comparing
        individual fibre diameters, we also model their spatial distribution, and
        compare the obtained model parameters. Our study shows that X-ray CT is a
        high precision technique for characterising fibre composites and, with our
        suggested image analysis method for fibre detection, high precision is also
        obtained at low resolutions. This has great potential, since it allows larger
        fields of view to be analysed. Besides analysing representative volumes with

        on optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina in both healthy and diseased
        eyes. Systematic studies may benefit from the development of automated tools
        that can map and track such foci. The outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina
        is an attractive layer in which to study hyperreflective foci as it has no
        fixed hyperreflective elements in healthy eyes. In this study, we intended
        to evaluate whether automated image analysis can identify, quantify and visualize
        hyperreflective foci in the ONL of the retina.This longitudinal exploratory

      abstract: We present a deep learning model for image segmentation that uses
        weakly supervised inputs consisting of scribbles. A user can draw scribbles
        on an image with a brush tool corresponding to the labels they want segmented.
        The network can segment images in real time while scribbles are being drawn,
        giving instant feedback to the user. It is easy to correct mistakes made by
        the network, as more scribbles can be added. During training we use a similar
        psuedo-interactive and iterative setup to make sure that the network is optimized
        towards the human-in-the-loop inference setting. On the contrary, standard
        scribble segmentation methods do not consider the training of the algorithm
        as an interactive setting and thus are not suited for interactive inference.
        Our model is class-agnostic and we are able to generalize across many different
        data modalities. We compare our model with other weakly supervised methods
        such as bounding box and extrema point methods, and we show our model achieves
        a better mean DICE score.

      abstract: We train several language models for Icelandic, including IceBERT,
        that achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of downstream tasks,
        including part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, grammatical error
        detection and constituency parsing. To train the models we introduce a new
        corpus of Icelandic text, the Icelandic Common Crawl Corpus (IC3), a collection
        of high quality texts found online by targeting the Icelandic top-level-domain
        (TLD). Several other public data sources are also collected for a total of
        16GB of Icelandic text. To enhance the evaluation of model performance and
        to raise the bar in baselines for Icelandic, we translate and adapt the WinoGrande
        dataset for co-reference resolution. Through these efforts we demonstrate
        that a properly cleaned crawled corpus is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art
        results in NLP applications for low to medium resource languages, by comparison
        with models trained on a curated corpus. We further show that initializing
        models using existing multilingual models can lead to state-of-the-art results
        for some downstream tasks.

        is well recognized but understudied. We used natural language processing (NLP)
        of Twitter posts to analyse the sentiments expressed in relation to a pre-eruptive
        seismic unrest, and a subsequent volcanic eruption in Iceland 2021. We show
        that despite the small size and negligible material damage, these geohazards
        were associated with a measurable change in expressed emotions in the local
        populations. The seismic unrest was associated with predominantly negative
        sentiments, but the eruption with predominantly positive. We demonstrate a
        cost-effective tool for gauging public discourse that could be used in risk
        management.

      abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is the task of correcting typos,
        spelling, punctuation and grammatical issues in text. Approaching the problem
        as a sequence-to-sequence task, we compare the use of a common subword unit
        vocabulary and byte-level encoding. Initial synthetic training data is created
        using an error-generating pipeline, and used for finetuning two subword-level
        models and one byte-level model. Models are then finetuned further on hand-corrected
        error corpora, including texts written by children, university students, dyslexic
        and second-language writers, and evaluated over different error types and
        origins. We show that a byte-level model enables higher correction quality
        than a subword approach, not only for simple spelling errors, but also for
        more complex semantic, stylistic and grammatical issues. In particular, initial
        training on synthetic corpora followed by finetuning on a relatively small
        parallel corpus of real-world errors helps the byte-level model correct a
        wide range of commonly occurring errors. Our experiments are run for the Icelandic
        language but should hold for other similar languages, particularly morphologically
        rich ones.

        and phylogenetic relations to other languages. In particular, readily available
        data and models of resource-rich sibling languages are often ignored. In this
        work, we empirically show, in a case study for Faroese -- a low-resource language
        from a high-resource language family -- that by leveraging the phylogenetic
        information and departing from the 'one-size-fits-all' paradigm, one can improve
        cross-lingual transfer to low-resource languages. In particular, we leverage
        abundant resources of other Scandinavian languages (i.e., Danish, Norwegian,
        Swedish, and Icelandic) for the benefit of Faroese. Our evaluation results
        show that we can substantially improve the transfer performance to Faroese
        by exploiting data and models of closely-related high-resource languages.
        Further, we release a new web corpus of Faroese and Faroese datasets for named
        entity recognition (NER), semantic text similarity (STS), and new language
        models trained on all Scandinavian languages.

      abstract: The ability to assess the robustness of image classifiers to a diverse
        set of manipulations is essential to their deployment in the real world. Recently,
        semantic manipulations of real images have been considered for this purpose,
        as they may not arise using standard adversarial settings. However, such semantic
        manipulations are often limited to style, color or attribute changes. While
        expressive, these manipulations do not consider the full capacity of a pretrained
        generator to affect adversarial image manipulations. In this work, we aim
        at leveraging the full capacity of a pretrained image generator to generate
        highly detailed, diverse and photorealistic image manipulations. Inspired
        by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method called Adversarial
        Pivotal Tuning (APT). APT first finds a pivot latent space input to a pretrained
        generator that best reconstructs an input image. It then adjusts the …

      abstract: 'Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the
        generation of diverse and high-quality images. However, generated images often
        fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to
        ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train
        diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This comes with a downside, doing
        so limits their expressive power: (i) supervised datasets are generally small
        compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image
        models are trained, and so the quality and diversity of generated images are
        severely affected, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to
        free-form text, which limits the control over the generated images. In this
        work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on
        the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through
        discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier, which guides the generation.
        This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of a single input token
        of a text-to-image diffusion model, using the classifier, by steering generated
        images toward a given target class. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning
        methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining
        of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing
        that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than
        standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a
        low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to

      abstract: A key component of computational biology is to compare the results
        of computer modelling with experimental measurements. Despite substantial
        progress in the models and algorithms used in many areas of computational
        biology, such comparisons sometimes reveal that the computations are not in
        quantitative agreement with experimental data. The principle of maximum entropy
        is a general procedure for constructing probability distributions in the light
        of new data, making it a natural tool in cases when an initial model provides
        results that are at odds with experiments. The number of maximum entropy applications
        in our field has grown steadily in recent years, in areas as diverse as sequence
        analysis, structural modelling, and neurobiology. In this Perspectives article,
        we give a broad introduction to the method, in an attempt to encourage its
        further adoption. The general procedure is explained in the context of a simple
        example, after which we proceed with a real-world application in the field
        of molecular simulations, where the maximum entropy procedure has recently
        provided new insight. Given the limited accuracy of force fields, macromolecular
        simulations sometimes produce results that are at not in complete and quantitative
        accordance with experiments. A common solution to this problem is to explicitly
        ensure agreement between the two by perturbing the potential energy function
        towards the experimental data. So far, a general consensus for how such perturbations
        should be implemented has been lacking. Three very recent papers have explored
        this problem using the maximum entropy approach, providing both new theoretical

      abstract: Predicting the thermodynamic stability of proteins is a common and
        widely used step in protein engineering, and when elucidating the molecular
        mechanisms behind evolution and disease. Here, we present RaSP, a method for
        making rapid and accurate predictions of changes in protein stability by leveraging
        deep learning representations. RaSP performs on-par with biophysics-based
        methods and enables saturation mutagenesis stability predictions in less than
        a second per residue. We use RaSP to calculate∼ 230 million stability changes
        for nearly all single amino acid changes in the human proteome, and examine
        variants observed in the human population. We find that variants that are
        common in the population are substantially depleted for severe destabilization,
        and that there are substantial differences between benign and pathogenic variants,
        highlighting the role of protein stability in genetic diseases. RaSP is freely
        available—including via a Web interface—and enables large-scale analyses of
        stability in experimental and predicted protein structures.

      abstract: We provide a new automated statistical method for DNA barcoding based
        on a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. The method is based on automated database
        sequence retrieval, alignment, and phylogenetic analysis using a custom-built
        program for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. We show on real data that the
        method outperforms Blast searches as a measure of confidence and can help
        eliminate 80% of all false assignment based on best Blast hit. However, the
        most important advance of the method is that it provides statistically meaningful
        measures of confidence. We apply the method to a re-analysis of previously
        published ancient DNA data and show that, with high statistical confidence,
        most of the published sequences are in fact of Neanderthal origin. However,
        there are several cases of chimeric sequences that are comprised of a combination
        of both Neanderthal and modern human DNA.

      abstract: After the recent ground-breaking advances in protein structure prediction,
        one of the remaining challenges in protein machine learning is to reliably
        predict distributions of structural states. Parametric models of small-scale
        fluctuations are difficult to fit due to complex covariance structures between
        degrees of freedom in the protein chain, often causing models to either violate
        local or global structural constraints. In this paper, we present a new strategy
        for modelling protein densities in internal coordinates, which uses constraints
        in 3D space to induce covariance structure between the internal degrees of
        freedom. We illustrate the potential of the procedure by constructing a variational
        autoencoder with full covariance output induced by the constraints implied
        by the conditional mean in 3D, and demonstrate that our approach makes it
        possible to scale density models of internal coordinates to full-size proteins.

      abstract: In terms of its relative frequency, lysine is a common amino acid
        in the human proteome. However, by bioinformatics we find hundreds of proteins
        that contain long and evolutionarily conserved stretches completely devoid
        of lysine residues. These so-called lysine deserts show a high prevalence
        in intrinsically disordered proteins with known or predicted functions within
        the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), including many E3 ubiquitin-protein
        ligases and UBL domain proteasome substrate shuttles, such as BAG6, RAD23A,
        UBQLN1 and UBQLN2. We show that introduction of lysine residues into the deserts
        leads to a striking increase in ubiquitylation of some of these proteins.
        In case of BAG6, we show that ubiquitylation is catalyzed by the E3 RNF126,
        while RAD23A is ubiquitylated by E6AP. Despite the elevated ubiquitylation,
        mutant RAD23A appears stable, but displays a partial loss of function phenotype

        motions. The model uses scalar-, vector-, and tensor fields over 3D Euclidean
        space to represent data, and equivariant convolutions to map between such
        representations. These SE (3)-equivariant convolutions utilize kernels which
        are parameterized as a linear combination of a complete steerable kernel basis,
        which is derived analytically in this paper. We prove that equivariant convolutions
        are the most general equivariant linear maps between fields over R^ 3. Our
        experimental results confirm the effectiveness of 3D Steerable CNNs for the
        problem of amino acid propensity prediction and protein structure classification,
        both of which have inherent SE (3) symmetry.

      abstract: We present a method to approximate Gaussian process regression models
        to large datasets by considering only a subset of the data. Our approach is
        novel in that the size of the subset is selected on the fly during exact inference
        with little computational overhead. From an empirical observation that the
        log-marginal likelihood often exhibits a linear trend once a sufficient subset
        of a dataset has been observed, we conclude that many large datasets contain
        redundant information that only slightly affects the posterior. Based on this,
        we provide probabilistic bounds on the full model evidence that can identify
        such subsets. Remarkably, these bounds are largely composed of terms that
        appear in intermediate steps of the standard Cholesky decomposition, allowing
        us to modify the algorithm to adaptively stop the decomposition once enough
        data have been observed.

        and insects within the past million years. The results provide direct evidence
        in support of a forested southern Greenland and suggest that many deep ice
        cores may contain genetic records of paleoenvironments in their basal sections.

        in the stochastic setting with fixed delays. Specifically, the adversarial
        regret guarantee is , where  is the time horizon,  is the number of arms,
        and  is the fixed delay, whereas the stochastic regret guarantee is , where  are
        the suboptimality gaps. We also present an extension of the algorithm to the
        case of arbitrary delays, which is based on an oracle knowledge of the maximal
        delay  and achieves  regret in the adversarial regime, where  is the total
        delay, and  regret in the stochastic regime, where  is the maximal number
        of outstanding observations. Finally, we present a lower bound that matches
        regret upper bound achieved by the skipping technique of Zimmert and Seldin
        [2020] in the adversarial setting.

        pseudo-regret in both adversarial and stochastic multi-armed bandits without

        online mirror descent with Tsallis entropy regularizer. We provide a complete
        characterization of such algorithms and show that Tsallis entropy with power  achieves
        the goal. In addition, the proposed algorithm enjoys improved regret guarantees

        from the EXP3++ algorithm for stochastic and adversarial bandits and the EXP3.

        which exploits the structure of the graph to reduce exploration, is key to
        obtain best-of-both-worlds guarantees with feedback graphs. We also extend
        our algorithm and results to a setting where the feedback graphs are allowed

      abstract: We present an algorithm for multiarmed bandits that achieves almost
        optimal performance in both stochastic and adversarial regimes without prior
        knowledge about the nature of the environment. Our algorithm is based on augmentation
        of the EXP3 algorithm with a new control lever in the form of exploration
        parameters that are tailored individually for each arm. The algorithm simultaneously
        applies the “old” control lever, the learning rate, to control the regret
        in the adversarial regime and the new control lever to detect and exploit
        gaps between the arm losses. This secures problem-dependent “logarithmic”
        regret when gaps are present without compromising on the worst-case performance
        guarantee in the adversarial regime. We show that the algorithm can exploit
        both the usual expected gaps between the arm losses in the stochastic regime
        and deterministic gaps between the arm losses in the adversarial regime. The
        algorithm retains “logarithmic” regret guarantee in the stochastic regime
        even when some observations are contaminated by an adversary, as long as on
        average the contamination does not reduce the gap by more than a half. Our
        results for the stochastic regime are supported by experimental validation.

        We consider a model where intermediate observations have a form of a finite
        state, which is observed immediately after taking an action, whereas the loss
        is observed after an adversarially chosen delay. We show that the regime of
        the mapping of states to losses determines the complexity of the problem,
        irrespective of whether the mapping of actions to states is stochastic or
        adversarial. If the mapping of states to losses is adversarial, then the regret
        rate is of order  (within log factors), where  is the time horizon and  is
        a fixed delay. This matches the regret rate of a -armed bandit with delayed
        feedback and without intermediate observations, implying that intermediate
        observations are not helpful. However, if the mapping of states to losses
        is stochastic, we show that the regret grows at a rate of  (within log factors),

        [2022] by eliminating the need in prior knowledge of the maximal delay  and

        in the environment exists. We introduce a new model-free algorithm, called
        QL-ES (Q-learning with equivalence structure), which is a variant of (asynchronous)
        Q-learning tailored to exploit the equivalence structure in the MDP. We report
        a non-asymptotic PAC-type sample complexity bound for QL-ES, thereby establishing
        its sample efficiency. This bound also allows us to quantify the superiority
        of QL-ES over Q-learning analytically, which shows that the theoretical gain
        in some domains can be massive. We report extensive numerical experiments
        demonstrating that QL-ES converges significantly faster than (structure-oblivious)
        Q-learning empirically. They imply that the empirical performance gain obtained
        by exploiting the equivalence structure could be massive, even in simple domains.
        To the best of our knowledge, QL-ES is the first provably efficient model-free
        algorithm to exploit the equivalence structure in finite MDPs.

        is often performed by injecting noise either in action space at each step
        independently or in parameter space over each full trajectory. In prior work,
        it has been shown that with linear policies, a more balanced trade-off between
        these two exploration strategies is beneficial. However, that method did not
        scale to policies using deep neural networks. In this paper, we introduce

      abstract: Skyline queries are useful for finding interesting tuples from a large
        data set according to multiple criteria. The sizes of data sets are constantly
        increasing and the architecture of back-ends are switching from single-node
        environments to non-conventional paradigms like MapReduce. Despite the usefulness
        of skyline queries, existing works on skyline computation in MapReduce do
        not take full advantage of parallelism but still run significant parts serially.
        In this paper, we propose a novel approach to compute skylines efficiently
        in MapReduce. We design a grid partitioning scheme to divide the data space
        into partitions, and employ a bitstring to represent the partitions. The bitstring
        is efficiently obtained in MapReduce, and it clearly helps prune partitions
        (and tuples) that cannot have skyline tuples. Based on the grid partitioning,
        we propose two MapReduce algorithms to compute skylines. Both algorithms utilize
        the bitstring and distribute the original tuples to multiple mappers and make
        use of them to compute local skylines in parallel. In particular, MapReduce
        Grid Partitioning based Single-Reducer Skyline Computation (MR-GPSRS) employs
        a single reducer to assemble the local skylines appropriately to compute the
        global skyline. In contrast, MapReduce Grid Partitioning based Multiple Reducer
        Skyline Computation (MR-GPMRS) further divides local skylines and distributes
        them to multiple reducers that compute the global skyline in an independent
        and parallel manner. The proposed algorithms are evaluated through extensive
        experiments, and the results show that MR-GPMRS significantly outperforms
        the alternatives in various settings.

      abstract: Modern stream processing systems typically require ingesting and correlating
        data from multiple data sources. However, these sources are out of control
        and prone to software errors and unavailability, causing data anomalies that
        must be necessarily remedied before processing the data. In this context,
        anomaly, such as data duplication, appears as one of the most prominent challenges
        of stream processing. Data duplication can hinder real-time analysis of data
        for decision making. This paper investigates the challenges and performs an
        experimental analysis of operators and auxiliary tools to help with data deduplication.
        The results show that there is an increase in data delivery time when using
        external mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are essential for an ingestion
        process to guarantee that no data is lost and that no duplicates are persisted.

        which would be very expensive to run if the data are not carefully partitioned

      abstract: The vast amounts of data collected in various domains pose great challenges
        to modern data exploration and analysis. To find "interesting" objects in
        large databases, users typically define a query using positive and negative
        example objects and train a classification model to identify the objects of
        interest in the entire data catalog. However, this approach requires a scan
        of all the data to apply the classification model to each instance in the
        data catalog, making this method prohibitively expensive to be employed in
        large-scale databases serving many users and queries interactively. In this
        work, we propose a novel framework for such search-by-classification scenarios
        that allows users to interactively search for target objects by specifying
        queries through a small set of positive and negative examples. Unlike previous
        approaches, our framework can rapidly answer such queries at low cost without
        scanning the entire database. Our framework is based on an index-aware construction
        scheme for decision trees and random forests that transforms the inference
        phase of these classification models into a set of range queries, which in
        turn can be efficiently executed by leveraging multidimensional indexing structures.
        Our experiments show that queries over large data catalogs with hundreds of

      abstract: Microservices have become a popular architectural style for data-driven
        applications, given their ability to functionally decompose an application
        into small and autonomous services to achieve scalability, strong isolation,
        and specialization of database systems to the workloads and data formats of
        each service. Despite the accelerating industrial adoption of this architectural
        style, an investigation of the state of the practice and challenges practitioners
        face regarding data management in microservices is lacking. To bridge this
        gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of representative articles
        reporting the adoption of microservices, we analyzed a set of popular open-source
        microservice applications, and we conducted an online survey to cross-validate
        the findings of the previous steps with the perceptions and experiences of
        over 120 experienced practitioners and researchers. Through this process,
        we were able to categorize the state of practice of data management in microservices
        and observe several foundational challenges that cannot be solved by software
        engineering practices alone, but rather require system-level support to alleviate
        the burden imposed on practitioners. We discuss the shortcomings of state-of-the-art
        database systems regarding microservices and we conclude by devising a set
        of features for microservice-oriented database systems.

      abstract: The actor model has been widely adopted in building stateful middle-tiers
        for large-scale interactive applications, where ACID transactions are useful
        to ensure application correctness. In this paper, we present Snapper, a new
        transaction library on top of Orleans, a popular actor system. Snapper exploits
        the characteristics of actor-oriented programming to improve the performance
        of multi-actor transactions by employing deterministic transaction execution,
        where pre-declared actor access information is used to generate deterministic
        execution schedules. The deterministic execution can potentially improve transaction
        throughput significantly, especially with a high contention level. Besides,
        Snapper can also execute actor transactions using conventional nondeterministic
        strategies, including S2PL, to account for scenarios where actor access information
        cannot be pre-declared. A salient feature of Snapper is the …

      abstract: 'There is an emerging trend of migrating traditional service-oriented
        monolithic systems to the microservice architecture. However, this involves
        the separation of data previously contained in a single database into several
        databases tailored to specific domains. Developers are thus faced with a new
        challenge: features such as transaction processing, coordination, and consistency
        preservation, which were previously supported by the central database, must
        now be implemented in a decentralized, asynchronously communicating, distributed
        structure. Numerous prior studies show that these challenges are not met satisfactorily,
        resulting in inconsistent system states with potentially detrimental consequences.
        Therefore, we propose to design a coordination service that relies on clear
        event-based and data-centric formal semantics for microservices specifying
        the interaction of cross-microservice transactions with their …'

        Microservices
    Tqh1RIkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC:
      abstract: Skyline queries are capable of retrieving interesting points from
        a large data set according to multiple criteria. Most work on skyline queries
        so far has assumed a centralized storage, whereas in practice relevant data
        are often distributed among geographically scattered sites. In this work,
        we tackle constrained skyline queries in large-scale distributed environments
        without the assumption of any overlay structures, and propose a novel algorithm
        named PaDSkyline (Parallel distributed Skyline query processing). PaDSkyline
        significantly shortens the response time by performing parallel processing
        over site groups produced by a partition algorithm. Within each group, it
        locally optimizes the query processing over distributed sites. It also drastically
        enhances the network transmission efficiency by performing early reduction
        of skyline candidates with deliberately selected multiple filtering points.

      abstract: When there are multiple queries posed to the resource-constrained
        wireless sensor network, it is critical to process them efficiently. In this
        paper, we propose a two-tier multiple query optimization (TTMQO) scheme. The
        first tier, called base station optimization, adopts a cost-based approach
        to rewrite a set of queries into an optimized set that shares the commonality
        and eliminates the redundancy among the queries in the original set. The optimized
        queries are then injected into the wireless sensor network. In the second
        tier, called in-network optimization, our scheme efficiently delivers query
        results by taking advantage of the broadcast nature of the radio channel and
        sharing the sensor readings among similar queries over time and space at a
        finer granularity. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed TTMQO
        scheme offers significant improvements over the traditional single query optimization
        technique.
